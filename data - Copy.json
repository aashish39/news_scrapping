        ", , /PRNewswire/ -- Immunexpress, Pty Ltd., a molecular diagnostics company focused on improving outcomes for suspected sepsis patients, today announced the publication of a study in the ,. The article, entitled, \"Rapid and Robust Identification of Sepsis Using SeptiCyte RAPID in a Heterogeneous Patient Population,\" is published in the Special Issue \"Sepsis and Organ Dysfunction: New Insights into Diagnosis and Treatment\" and may be accessed ,. \u00a0,\"Not only did SeptiCyte RAPID consistently discriminate between sepsis and SIRS across races, disparate medical conditions, therapeutic regimens, and source of infection, but it was also able to classify patients into distinct phenotypes by clinical severity. Phenotyping complex patients with sepsis is key to identifying the most appropriate and individualized treatments,\" commented ,, MD, MSc, Distinguished Professor and Director\u00a0of Pulmonary, Allergy, Critical Care and Sleep Medicine, Department of Medicine, ,, ,, and co-author of the publication.,\"Patients' pre-existing medical conditions may affect the body's immune response to an infection as well as the clinical parameters that are used to diagnose sepsis. The validity of a diagnostic test for sepsis is dependent on its ability to discern between sepsis and SIRS in these various critically ill patient populations, including immunocompromised patients and those with cancer,\" commented ,, MD, PhD, MHA, Chief Medical Officer of Immunexpress.,SeptiCyte\u00ae RAPID performance was largely unaffected by key variables associated with heterogeneity in patients suspected of sepsis (n=419), including those from different racial groups and underlying disease states. SeptiCyte RAPID was effective in identifying septic shock in both Black patients (AUC 0.96) and White patients (AUC 0.83). No significant difference in SeptiCyte RAPID performance was observed based on the presence or absence of hyperglycemia, impaired immunity, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, kidney disease, cancer, or obesity.,Two to three distinct patient subgroups were observed in sepsis patients (n=176) using unsupervised learning methods. One subgroup appeared to be mainly populated by patients exhibiting more severe sepsis, including septic shock. Two to three distinct patient subgroups were observed in the entire study, sepsis or SIRS cohort (n=419). SeptiCyte RAPID exhibited consistently strong performance (AUC 0.79-0.89) across subgroups in both sepsis and SIRS patients. Phenotypic stratification may be useful for categorizing sepsis patients into subgroups based on clinical severity, which in turn may inform the appropriate therapeutic interventions.,SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID is a sample-to-answer, cartridge-based, host response molecular test for sepsis using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to quantify the relative expression levels of host response genes isolated from whole blood. SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID is used in conjunction with clinical assessments, vital signs and laboratory findings as an aid to differentiate infection-positive (sepsis) from infection-negative systemic inflammation response syndromes in patients with escalating signs and symptoms of critical illness. SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID generates a score (SeptiScore\u00ae) that falls within four discrete interpretation bands based on the increasing likelihood of sepsis. SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID is intended for in-vitro diagnostic use and runs on the Biocartis Idylla\u2122 Platform.,SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID is CE Marked as a near-patient sample-to-answer test in European Union (EU) member countries and those harmonized with the EU IVD Directive (98/79/EC). As of\u00a0November 2021, SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID has been FDA cleared for use in hospitalized patients suspected of sepsis.,Immunexpress is a molecular diagnostic company, based in\u00a0Brisbane\u00a0and\u00a0Seattle, committed to improving outcomes for patients suspected of sepsis. Immunexpress' SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0technology can assess a patient's dysregulated immune response by quantifying and analyzing gene expression from whole blood, providing actionable results in about an hour from sepsis suspicion, to guide the physician in optimizing patient management decisions. SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID is a lab test for sepsis that combines SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0technology with the ease-of-use of the revolutionary Biocartis' Idylla\u2122 Platform; it supports differentiating infection (bacterial, viral, fungal) positive sepsis that could lead to organ dysfunction and death from patients with less serious infection negative systemic inflammation. This powerful test enhances early sepsis detection and can strongly support its diagnosis in the crucial first hour(s) that determines clinical outcome. SeptiCyte\u00ae\u00a0RAPID also has a high potential to reduce sepsis associated healthcare costs.,For more information, visit\u00a0and\u00a0,.

        ", , /PRNewswire/ -- After careful consideration, Exchange Traded Concepts, LLC, the Fund's investment adviser has recommended, and the Board of Trustees of Exchange Traded Concepts Trust has approved, the termination and liquidation of the Fund pursuant to the terms of a Plan of\u202fLiquidation. Accordingly, the Fund is expected to cease operations and liquidate on or about , (the \"Liquidation\u202fDate\").\u00a0,The Fund will be closed to orders for new creation units on ,, and the last day of trading of the Fund's shares on the NYSE Arca, Inc. will be on or about ,. From , through the last day of trading, shareholders may only be able to sell their shares to certain broker-dealers, and there is no assurance that there will be a market for Fund shares during that time period. Customary brokerage charges may apply to such transactions. From the last day of trading through the Liquidation Date, shareholders will not be able to purchase or sell shares in the secondary market.\u00a0\u00a0,In anticipation of the liquidation, the Fund will be managed in a manner intended to facilitate its orderly liquidation, such as by raising cash or making investments in other highly liquid assets. As a result, in preparation for the liquidation, all or a portion of the Fund may not be invested in a manner consistent with its stated investment strategy, which may prevent the Fund from achieving its investment objective.\u00a0\u00a0,On or about the\u202fLiquidation Date, the Fund will liquidate its assets and distribute cash pro rata to all remaining shareholders. These distributions are taxable events. In addition, these payments to shareholders will include accrued capital gains and dividends, if any. As calculated on the Liquidation Date, the Fund's net asset value will reflect the costs of liquidating the Fund. Once the distributions are complete, the Fund will terminate.\u00a0,Investing involves risk, including possible loss of principal. International investments may also involve risk from unfavorable fluctuations in currency values, differences in generally accepted accounting principles, and from economic or political instability. Emerging markets involve heightened risks related to the same factors as well as increased volatility and lower trading volume. Narrowly focused investments and investments in smaller companies typically exhibit higher volatility. There is no guarantee the fund will achieve its stated objective.,There is no assurance that stocks selected according to the natural language processing algorithm will outperform stocks of other companies. There is no guarantee that the Methodology will generate or produce the intended results.,The technology relating to digital assets is new and developing. Currently, there are few public companies for which digital asset technology represents an attributable and significant revenue stream. Digital asset technology may never develop optimized transactional processes that lead to increased realized economic returns to any company in which the Fund invests. In addition, an investment in companies actively engaged in digital asset technology may be subject to the risks: that digital asset technology is new and many of its uses may be untested; that the cryptographic keys necessary to transact on a digital asset ledger may be subject to theft, loss, or destruction; that competing platforms and technologies may be developed such that consumers or investors use an alternative to digital assets; that companies that use digital asset technology may be subject to cybersecurity risk; that companies may not be able to develop digital asset technology applications or may not be able to capitalize on those technologies; that digital asset companies may be subject to the risks posed by conflicting intellectual property claims; that there may be a lack of liquid markets and possible manipulation of digital assets; that there may be risks posed by the lack of regulation in this space; and that digital asset systems built using third party products may be subject to technical defects or vulnerabilities beyond a company's control.,Companies' involvement in green energy transport and technology is a relatively new development and there can be no assurance that such companies' goods and services will be widely adopted by the general public. Such companies may be sensitive to risks associated with emerging technology companies, which include, but are not limited to, small or limited markets for securities of such companies, changes in business cycles, world economic growth, technological progress, rapid obsolescence, and government regulation. Rapid change to technologies that affect a company's products could have a material adverse effect on such company's operating results. These companies may rely on a combination of patents, copyrights, trademarks and trade secret laws to establish and protect their proprietary rights in their products and technologies. There can be no assurance that the steps taken by these companies to protect their proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent the misappropriation of their technology or that competitors will not independently develop technologies that are substantially equivalent or superior to such companies' technology.,Shares are bought and sold at market price not net asset value (NAV) and are not individually redeemed from the Fund.\u00a0The market price returns are based on the official closing price of an ETF share or, if the official closing price isn't available, the midpoint between the national best bid and national best offer (\"NBBO\") as of the time the ETF calculates current NAV per share, and do not represent the returns you would receive if you traded shares at other times.

While the small-cap sector is currently trading at a discount relative to the broader market, it is also ripe with inefficiencies. These inefficiencies arise from a growing trend where many investors, rather than focusing on individual businesses, gain exposure through broad market ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). We believe in owning businesses with strong competitive moats, the potential for high-quality reinvestment opportunities, and management teams whose incentives are aligned with our long-term objectives.

An investment in the Fund involves risk, including the following principal risks, among others: Equity Risk, Sector Focus Risk, Market Risk, Small-Cap Company Risk, Preferred Securities Risk, Convertible Securities Risk, Currency Risk, Value-Oriented Investment Strategies Risk, Foreign Investment Risk, and Management and Strategy Risk. Summary descriptions of these and other principal risks of investing in the Fund are set forth in the Fund's prospectus.

Please see the Fund's prospectus for additional risk disclosures.,The Morningstar Rating\u2122 for funds, or \"star rating\", is calculated monthly for managed products (including mutual funds, variable annuity and variable life subaccounts, exchange-traded funds, closed-end funds, and separate accounts) with at least a three-year history. Exchange-traded funds and open-ended mutual funds are considered a single population for comparative purposes. It is calculated based on a Morningstar Risk-Adjusted Return measure that accounts for variation in a managed product's monthly excess performance, placing more emphasis on downward variations and rewarding consistent performance. The top 10% of products in each product category receive 5 stars, the next 22.5% receive 4 stars, the next 35% receive 3 stars, the next 22.5% receive 2 stars, and the bottom 10% receive 1 star. The Overall Morningstar Rating for a managed product is derived from a weighted average of the performance figures associated with its three-, five-, and 10-year (if applicable) Morningstar Rating metrics. The weights are: 100% three-year rating for 36-59 months of total returns, 60% five-year rating/40% three-year rating for 60-119 months of total returns, and 50% 10-year rating/30% five-year rating/20% three-year rating for 120 or more months of total returns. While the 10-year overall star rating formula seems to give the most weight to the 10-year period, the most recent three-year period actually has the greatest impact because it is included in all three rating periods. The Rating/Ranking may reflect the waiver of all or a portion of the fund's fees. Without such waiver, the Ratings/Rankings may have been lower.,\u00a9 2025 Morningstar, Inc. All Rights Reserved.

        ", , /PRNewswire/ -- A news report from\u00a0China.org.cn on the Chinese blockbuster \"Ne Zha 2\":, the little boy with his two dark eye circles goes viral, the Chinese animated film \"Ne Zha 2: Demon Child Conquers the Sea\" has become the biggest blockbuster five years after its prequel was screened. First becoming the highest-grossing movie in , and even ,, then climbing up the ladder at the global box office, the animation has made its name before all the ,-made highest-grossing movies.,\n              \n            ,Last week, \"Ne Zha 2\" made its way into offshore cinemas, setting new records with each passing day.,Those who have watched it proved it to be worth the experience. 138 Chinese home-grown animation teams pooled efforts and weaved over 1,900 special effects shots, and more than 10,000 special effect elements, presenting the audience with meticulous yet grand spectacles. Strengthening the prowess is craftsmanship: Creative teams took about six months to finish the storyboard for one minute of motions; a saber was iterated about 200 times, taking a year and a half to perfect\u2026,The quality animation work is also rooted in unique Chinese culture. For example, the story set that Nezha and Aobing, the two leading characters were seemingly born to oppose each other, yet their fates were intertwined, implying the Taoist philosophy where yin and yang generate and counteract with each other, forming a dialectical unity. On character design, the boundary guardian beasts were inspired by the golden and bronze masks excavated from the Sanxingdui and Jinsha Ruins. Even for its background music, unique folk music was adopted: The Grand Song of the Dong ethnic group was used to help express an ethereal feeling, and throat singing (Khoomei), a traditional art form of the Mongolian ethnic group was used to help strengthen the gloomy atmosphere.,These are yet to be the most appealing part.,In \"Ne Zha 1,\" the \"demon child\" Nezha was faced with prejudices and misunderstandings, while he shouted out the iconic line \"I'm the master of my own destiny.\" In its sequel, the boy fought against oppression and unfairness with his life for what he wanted to guard \u2014 \"If there's no path ahead, I will forge one out!\" Such spirits of fighting against oppression and sticking to what's important were also embodied in Aobing and numerous other characters in the film. When the characters from different clans with various identities joined forces to stand against what's imposed on them, the most genuine and intuitive power spilled over to real life \u2014 combating one's destiny and pursuing self-value is instinctive to human will, immune to differences in cultures, nationalities or identities, which strikes strong resonance in filmgoers.,Many among the audience also shed tears for the most sincere and selfless love from Mother; many felt great sympathy for Shen Gongbao, who worked diligently but never got what he deserved; and many have different understandings but are equally touched by the \"youthful passion\" of Nezha and Aobing who attempt to change the world.,One can say, the quality animated production and the profound culture it crystallizes are what glittered the movie, but what really brings the work to the global audience's hearts, is the common pursuit of humanity, which was penetrated throughout the story.,If you get a chance, go learn the story of Nezha.

This is the lowest Manufacturing PMI, reading in 2024. The overall economy continued in expansion for the 54th month after one month of contraction in ,. (A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.) The New Orders Index remained in contraction territory, registering 47.1 percent, 1 percentage point higher than the 46.1 percent recorded in September. The October reading of the Production Index (46.2 percent) is 3.6 percentage points lower than September's figure of 49.8 percent. The Prices Index returned to expansion (or 'increasing') territory, registering 54.8 percent, up 6.5 percentage points compared to the reading of 48.3 percent in September. The Backlog of Orders Index registered 42.3 percent, down 1.8 percentage points compared to the 44.1 percent recorded in September. The Employment Index registered 44.4 percent, up 0.5 percentage point from September's figure of 43.9 percent.,\"The Supplier Deliveries Index indicated slowing deliveries, registering 52 percent, 0.2 percentage point lower than the 52.2 percent recorded in September. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM, , index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Inventories Index registered 42.6 percent, down 1.3 percentage points compared to September's reading of 43.9 percent.,\"The New Export Orders Index reading of 45.5 percent is 0.2 percentage point higher than the 45.3 percent registered in September. The Imports Index remained in contraction territory in October, registering 48.3 percent, the same reading as reported in September.\",Fiore continues, \"U.S. manufacturing activity contracted again in October, and at a faster rate compared to last month. Demand continues to be weak, output declined, and inputs stayed accommodative. , slowing was reflected by the (1) New Orders Index remaining in contraction territory, (2) New Export Orders Index contracting moderately, (3) Backlog of Orders Index dropping further into strong contraction territory, and (4) Customers' Inventories Index indicating customers' inventories were 'too low.' (For more, see the Customers' Inventories Index summary section.) , (measured by the Production and Employment indexes) continued in contraction: Employment shrunk, but at a slower rate, while production moved further into contraction. Panelists cited continuing efforts by their companies to right-size workforces to levels consistent with forecasted demand. , \u2014 defined as supplier deliveries, inventories, prices and imports \u2014 generally continued to accommodate future demand growth, with inventories returning to low levels and suppliers continuing to show marginal difficulty in meeting customer needs.,\"Demand remains subdued, as companies continue to show an unwillingness to invest in capital and inventory due to concerns (for example, inflation resurgence) about federal monetary policy direction in light of the fiscal policies proposed by both major parties. Production execution eased in October, consistent with demand sluggishness. Suppliers continue to have capacity, with lead times improving and some shortages reappearing. Sixty-three percent of manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in October, down from 77 percent in September. The share of manufacturing sector GDP registering a composite PMI, calculation at or below 45 percent (a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness) was 46 percent in October, a 5-percentage point increase compared to the 41 percent reported in September. Only two of the six largest manufacturing industries \u2014 Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products\u00a0\u2014 expanded in October, compared to one in September,\" says Fiore.,The five manufacturing industries reporting growth in October are: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing.\u00a0The 11 industries reporting contraction in October \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Printing & Related Support Activities; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Machinery; Primary Metals; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Fabricated Metal Products; and Paper Products., data is seasonally adjusted for the New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories indexes.,*Number of months moving in current direction.,Aluminum (11); Copper; Corrugated Boxes (4); Crude Oil; Natural Gas; Paper; Printed Circuit Boards; Road Freight; and Sulfuric Acid.,Polypropylene; and Steel (6).,Electrical Components (49); and Electronic Components (7).,Note: The number of consecutive months the commodity is listed is indicated after each item.,The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the seventh consecutive month in October, as the Manufacturing PMI, registered 46.5 percent, 0.7 percentage point lower compared to the 47.2 percent reported in September and August. This is the lowest reading since , (46.5 percent). \"After breaking a 16-month streak of contraction by expanding in March, the manufacturing sector has contracted the last seven months. Of the five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI,, only one (Supplier Deliveries) was in expansion territory, the same as in September. The New Orders and Production indexes remained in contraction, but the New Orders Index moved slightly upward in October.\u00a0Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, two (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) registered growth,\" says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.,A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.\u00a0Therefore, the October\u00a0Manufacturing PMI, indicates the overall economy grew for the 54th straight month after last contracting in ,. \"The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI, and the overall economy indicates that the October\u00a0reading (46.5 percent) corresponds to a change of plus-1.1 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,\" says Fiore.,ISM,'s New Orders Index contracted in October for the seventh consecutive month, registering 47.1 percent, an increase of 1 percentage point compared to September's figure of 46.1 percent. The New Orders Index hasn't indicated consistent growth since a 24-month streak of expansion ended in ,. \"Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, two (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported increased new orders. Panelists again noted a continued level of uncertainty and concern about a lack of new order activity, with a 1-to-1.2 ratio of positive comments versus those expressing concern about near-term demand, an improvement compared to September. Panelists expressed concern not only on the impacts of the upcoming U.S. election results but also on the Federal Reserve's ability to continue reducing rates in light of the fiscal policies expressed by both major parties,\" says Fiore. A New Orders Index above 52.3\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders (in constant ,).,The three manufacturing industries that reported growth in new orders in October are: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products. The 11 industries reporting a decline in new orders in October \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Printing & Related Support Activities; Paper Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Transportation Equipment; Furniture & Related Products; Chemical Products; Machinery; Primary Metals; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Fabricated Metal Products.,The Production Index continued in contraction territory in October, registering 46.2 percent, 3.6\u00a0percentage points lower than the September\u00a0reading of 49.8 percent. Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, three (Computer & Electronic Products; Fabricated Metal Products; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)\u00a0reported increased production. \"New order rates remain weak and backlog levels continue to decline, causing manufacturers to reduce their output and plan for lower production to close the calendar year. Companies continue to avoid investing in inventory due to the ongoing economic uncertainty,\" says Fiore. An index above\u00a052.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures.,The six industries reporting growth in production during the month of October \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Paper Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Plastics & Rubber Products. The eight industries reporting a decrease in production in October, in order, are: Textile Mills; Printing & Related Support Activities; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components.,ISM,'s Employment Index registered 44.4 percent in October, 0.5 percentage point higher than the September reading of 43.9 percent. The July, September and October readings are among the three lowest recorded since the index registered 43.7 percent in ,, early in the economic recovery. \"The index contracted for the fifth consecutive month after an expansion in May, which broke a seven-month streak of contraction. Of the six big manufacturing sectors, only one (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)\u00a0expanded employment in October. Respondents' companies are continuing to reduce head counts through layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes. This sentiment was supported in October by the approximately 1-to-3 ratio of hiring versus staff reduction comments, doubling last month's ratio in favor of the latter. Right-sizing the workforce across industries continues,\" says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.3\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the three industries reporting employment growth in October are: Wood Products; Paper Products; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products. The 10 industries reporting a decrease in employment in October, in the following order, are: Textile Mills; Printing & Related Support Activities; Chemical Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Plastics & Rubber Products; Furniture & Related Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Transportation Equipment; and Machinery.,Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was slower in October, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 52 percent, a 0.2-percentage point decrease compared to the reading of 52.2 percent reported in September. This is the fourth month of slower deliveries after four consecutive months of faster deliveries. After a reading of 52.4 percent in September\u00a02022, the index went into contraction territory the following month and remained there for 20 out of 21 months (with , as the sole exception). Of the six big industries, three (Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Machinery) reported slower supplier deliveries in October.\u00a0\"Supplier deliveries continue to slow as panelists' companies continue to rely on their suppliers to manage purchased material inventories,\" says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.,The seven manufacturing industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in October \u2014 listed in order \u2014 are: Furniture & Related Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Machinery. The four industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in October are: Paper Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Primary Metals; and Transportation Equipment. Seven industries reported no change in supplier deliveries in October as compared to September.,The Inventories Index registered 42.6 percent\u00a0in October, down 1.3 percentage points compared to the reading of\u00a043.9 percent reported in September. \"Manufacturing inventories remain at low levels as the contracting manufacturing economy continues to cause panelists' companies and their customers to closely manage working capital, including manufacturing inventory. Of the six big industries, none reported increased manufacturing inventories in October,\" says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained ,).,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the two industries reporting higher inventories in October are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; and Primary Metals. The 12 industries reporting lower inventories in October \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Wood Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Transportation Equipment; Machinery; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Chemical Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Computer & Electronic Products.,ISM,'s Customers' Inventories Index registered a reading of 46.8 percent in October, down 3.2 percentage points compared to the 50 percent reported in September. \"Customers' inventory levels in October\u00a0were on the high side of 'too low.' Panelists are reporting that the amounts of their products in their customers' inventories suggest a demand level that is positive for future new orders and production,\" says Fiore.,The five industries reporting customers' inventories as too high in October are: Textile Mills; Wood Products; Furniture & Related Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The seven industries reporting customers' inventories as too low in October, in order, are: Paper Products; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Primary Metals; Machinery; and Transportation Equipment.,\u00a0,\u00a0,The ISM, Prices Index registered 54.8 percent, 6.5\u00a0percentage points higher compared to the September\u00a0reading of 48.3 percent,\u00a0indicating raw materials prices increased in October after decreasing the month before.\u00a0Of the six largest manufacturing industries, five \u2014 Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Computer & Electronic Products\u00a0\u2014 reported price increases in October. \"The Prices Index indicated increasing prices in October, compared to the previous month. Energy and transportation costs were the primary drivers, with crude oil and natural gas increasing somewhat, offset by weakness in the steel markets. Twenty percent of companies reported higher prices in October, compared to 13 percent in September,\" says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.8\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.,In October, the 11 industries that reported paying increased prices for raw materials, in order, are: Textile Mills; Petroleum & Coal Products; Paper Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Wood Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Computer & Electronic Products.

Of the six largest manufacturing industries, two (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported expanded order backlogs in October. \"The index remained in contraction in October, as continued contraction in new orders and reduced production levels compared to September were insufficient to prevent backlogs from slowing their decline,\" says Fiore.,Of the 18 manufacturing industries, three reported growth in order backlogs in October: Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products.

Average lead time in October for Production Materials\u00a0was 81 days, an increase of one day compared to September. Average lead time for Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies was 46 days, unchanged from September.,DO NOT CONFUSE THIS NATIONAL REPORT with the various regional purchasing reports released across the country. The national report's information reflects the entire U.S., while the regional reports contain primarily regional data from their local vicinities. Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of ,.,The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing supply executives based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM,\u00a0makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data\u00a0should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.,The , is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The composition of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is stratified according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and each of the following NAICS-based industries' contribution to gross domestic product (GDP): Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Petroleum & Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture & Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies). The data are weighted based on each industry's contribution to GDP. According to BEA estimates (the average of the fourth quarter 2022 GDP estimate and the GDP estimates for first, second, and third quarter 2023, as released on ,), the six largest manufacturing industries are: Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Machinery; and Fabricated Metal Products.,Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For nine indicators (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Employment, and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. For Customers' Inventories, respondents report their assessment of their customers' stock levels of respondent companies' products , (rather than last month): too high, about right, and too low. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive).,The resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (Manufacturing PMI,, New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries, and Inventories (seasonally adjusted).,Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0above 42.5\u00a0percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 42.5\u00a0percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 42.5\u00a0percent is indicative of the extent of the expansion or decline.\u00a0With some of the indicators within this report, ISM, has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis. For the Customers' Inventories Index, numerically, a reading of 50 percent is \"about right.\" However, in practice and in the context of other data, customers' inventories may be considered to be \"about right\" if the diffusion index is between 52 percent (the high side of about right) and 48 percent (the low side of about right).,The , survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to report on information for the current month for U.S. operations only. ISM, receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM, then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month.,The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the , , monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.,Responses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Capital Expenditures; Production Materials; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days.

        ", , /PRNewswire/ -- When the climate crisis looms like a mirror above humanity, it reflects more than just ecological fractures\u2014it reveals how a new generation is weaving creative solutions into the fabric of sustainability. At\u00a0Tuya Smart's booth at ,, two young visionaries, each with a distinct artistic language, strip sustainability from grand, abstract narratives, crafting intuitive yet profoundly impactful works.,\n              , (,, ,) embeds the secret language of \"gazing across time and space\" into the warp and weft of silk\u2014where breathtaking landscapes are encapsulated within a cup, a quiet yet forceful call for renewal. Ingrid, on the other hand, salvages discarded plastics, fabrics, and overlooked materials, reconstructing their value in unexpected ways. While adults debate the meaning of sustainability, these young creators are already planting answers in the soil. Art, they remind us, need not provide the answer itself, but it must ask the right questions: How can aesthetics take root in sustainability? How do we rewrite the prelude to the future with creativity?,At this moment, we begin to see: sustainability is not a solemn monologue about salvation, but an invitation\u2014one issued by countless individuals in the language of creativity.,Born in the scenic city of ,, , (,, ,) is a prodigious post-2000s artist with a keen sensitivity to painting and color. From an early age, she traveled with her parents across more than 30 countries, exploring museums and cultural landmarks. She admires Monet's interplay of light and shadow, Michelangelo's celestial frescoes, and Botticelli's Venus, but her deepest love lies in traditional Chinese aesthetics. Like many young girls, 12-year-old , delights in wearing ,, playing with silk fans, and marveling at porcelain, embroidery, and handcrafted treasures.,She calls her portfolio ,\u2014a collection of paintings blooming like flowers in an imagined paradise. Her works have garnered numerous accolades both domestically and abroad, and a prominent artist from the Xiling Seal Society once called her a \"gifted young talent.\",: When I visited the Dunhuang Grottoes, I saw how the Buddhas' eyes seemed to watch over the earth. Later, while sketching outdoors, I witnessed landscapes marred by pollution. It struck me\u2014if the Buddha were watching, wouldn't he sigh at the sight? So, I decided to merge the lush scenery of ,\u00a0with the compassionate gaze of Dunhuang's frescoes, capturing the Buddha's sorrow at a wounded landscape.,: The cup filled with mountains and rivers symbolizes humanity's relentless consumption\u2014placing nature into a vessel, transforming a gift into poison. The Buddha's golden robes, stained with rust, mirror a sacred river tainted by pollution. I used Dunhuang's earthy pigments to depict withered mountains, and blended newspaper scraps into the clouds, concealing factory chimneys within the traditional brushstrokes of ,. The more harmonious the aesthetic, the more jarring the pollution appears.,: Painting on silk is difficult\u2014it wrinkles, it's slippery, and colors bleed unpredictably. My teacher introduced me to Dunhuang's overdyeing technique, allowing the translucent silk to reveal layers beneath. For the landscapes, silk absorbs pigment poorly, so I had to experiment with bone glue and alum water to fix the colors. As for pollution, acrylics wrinkled too easily, and mineral pigments peeled unpredictably. In the end, I realized that silk itself, with its natural cracks and translucency, captured the haunting effect of pollution\u2014black stains seeping like sewage into the earth, the folds on silk echoing the creases on the Buddha's forehead.,: After traveling the world, visiting landscapes and museums, I realized that traditional Chinese aesthetics resonate with me the most. I hope more people can see their beauty.,With this painting, I want to communicate with a broad audience\u2014people my age may notice how pollution scars natural beauty, while older generations might feel the urgency of environmental protection. I hope those who once thought \"environmental issues don't concern me\" will gain new insight through my work.,: At ,, a Brazilian grandpa told me the Buddha's tears reminded him of the disappearing tree gods of the Amazon rainforest. That's when I realized\u2014Dunhuang's art isn't just Chinese, it speaks to humanity's universal reverence for nature. Representing pollution through silk and the destruction of tradition is heartbreaking. If my painting sparks a conversation about environmental protection, then it has fulfilled its purpose.,: I want to sketch in Antarctica\u2014but more than that, I want to paint glaciers that have not yet disappeared.,My mother calls me the \"child of silk\"\u2014as delicate as a cicada's wing, yet carrying the boldest colors. I will continue using traditional aesthetics to document the ecological crisis and fight for the landscapes we are losing.,As a student at Governor's Academy, Ingrid constantly questions the intersection of art, life, and the environment. She believes that art has the power to lighten the burden businesses place on the planet and is passionate about bridging creativity, commerce, and ecology. To that end, she organizes events like the ,\u2014a celebration of sustainability, proving that discarded materials can be transformed into stunning, meaningful designs.,Ingrid: I looked at my overflowing closet and saw a cycle of waste\u2014clothes thrown away, donated, or left to rot in landfills. Every time I passed a trash bin, it was overflowing with used bottles, broken items, and outdated fashion. I thought, We live in a disposable culture, but the earth is not disposable. Why do we treat slightly worn-out things as trash?,So, I launched the ,\u2014an event that reimagines waste as art. I wanted to prove that \"trash\" can be transformed into something striking, that reusing and recycling isn't just responsible, but stylish. Environmentalism can be cool, and I want people to see that for themselves.,Ingrid: I find inspiration in discarded items\u2014scouring garbage bins, charity stores, and yard sales for overlooked treasures. A torn shirt collar, an embroidered pocket, or even a magazine cover can all be repurposed. I strip away what's unusable and focus on the details that hold character, transforming them into something entirely new. A broken lens can become the centerpiece of a necklace; an old curtain, the perfect embellishment for a dress.,The ,\u00a0is about more than creativity\u2014it's a mindset shift. It challenges us to rethink our relationship with waste, moving beyond consumption to creation. It's a reminder that what we throw away isn't necessarily worthless; instead, it might hold untapped potential waiting to be rediscovered.,Ingrid: Sustainability has often been framed as a sacrifice\u2014people assume that being environmentally conscious means giving up style. Through the ,, I want to prove that sustainability and fashion can coexist beautifully.,I hope that participants leave inspired to take action, whether by recycling more thoughtfully, repairing instead of discarding, or even reinventing their wardrobes with a creative touch. More importantly, I want this event to spark a shift in perception\u2014showing that sustainability isn't just responsible, but also incredibly cool. If even a handful of people start making small changes and influence those around them, then we're already making an impact.,Ingrid: The fashion industry still has so much untapped potential, particularly in serving underrepresented communities. In the future, I'd love to merge the principles of the , with inclusive design, creating an environmentally friendly clothing line tailored to people with different physical needs.,As society becomes more attuned to diversity and sustainability, I see this as an opportunity for new brands to emerge\u2014ones that don't just cater to trends but also address real-world issues. I want to be part of that change, designing clothing that is both eco-conscious and accessible to all.,Ingrid: The fashion industry is evolving\u2014people are increasingly aware of the environmental cost of their choices. The challenge now is making sustainability not just an alternative, but the norm.,Fast fashion is cheap but highly polluting, while sustainable clothing is often expensive and inaccessible. My focus is on closing that gap\u2014reducing costs through material innovation, raising awareness about sustainable fabrics, and fostering collaboration between designers and brands. The more we educate people about the true value of eco-friendly fashion, the more we can shift sustainability from being a luxury to a standard. Ultimately, beauty and ethics should go hand in hand.,Ingrid: One of my mentors once told me that the essence of fashion is constant reinvention. Looking ahead, I believe the industry must redefine its foundation, making sustainability a non-negotiable standard rather than an afterthought.,I envision a future where cutting-edge design and environmental responsibility are inseparable. My goal is to create a brand that stands out through creativity\u2014one that seamlessly integrates fashion and sustainability. But beyond my own work, I hope to see a collective movement, where designers, consumers, and businesses come together to drive change.,The next decade could be a turning point for fashion\u2014one where sustainability, innovation, and commerce intersect harmoniously. I want my brand to be a force in that transformation, proving that sustainability isn't just possible in fashion\u2014it's the future.,I imagine a world where every discarded item is not waste, but a canvas\u2014waiting for someone with vision to uncover its hidden beauty.,These two teenage artists weave an ecological fable through serigraphy and recycled plastic. Mineral pigments hold the memory of 32 layers of tundra, while discarded bottle caps form intricate mosaics, interwoven with environmental data. They take the remnants of civilization and forge them into the rivets of an ecological ark\u2014where art becomes a form of precision surgery, reconstructing the genetic makeup of sustainability.,Through creativity, they breathe new life into what was once lost, ensuring that the story of sustainability is not just told, but lived.,SOURCE ,Tuya Smart (NYSE: TUYA, HKEX: 2391), a global AI cloud platform service provider, is redefining the possibilities of smart energy with its unique...,Tuya Smart (NYSE: TUYA, HKEX: 2391), a global AI cloud platform service provider, has integrated the DeepSeek large language model into its AIoT...",

The tax impact of adjusting items is calculated using the effective tax rate during the quarter except for adjustments that, given their magnitude, can drive a change in the effective tax rate, in these cases, we use the actual tax expense or combined marginal rate of approximately 25%. The Company expects adjustments to 2025 reported diluted EPS to include an adjustment to remove equity in net income of DIRECTV, a non-cash mark-to-market benefit plan gain/loss, and other items. The adjustment to remove the equity in net income of DIRECTV is dependent upon cash distributions from DIRECTV and the timing of the closing of the sale of our DIRECTV investment, which is expected in mid-2025. The Company expects the mark-to-market adjustment, which is driven by interest rates and investment returns that are not reasonably estimable at this time, to be a significant item. Our projected first-quarter and full-year 2025 adjusted EPS depends on future levels of revenues and expenses, most of which are not reasonably estimable at this time.

Prematurity is associated with a significantly increased risk of major long-term medical complications, including learning disabilities, cerebral palsy, chronic respiratory illness, intellectual disability, seizures, and vision and hearing loss, and can generate significant costs throughout the lives of affected children.

        "FireflySci Shares Firsthand Challenges as Costs Surge by Over , Annually,, , /PRNewswire/ -- Small businesses across , are grappling with an alarming rise in health insurance costs, a growing burden that threatens their financial stability, employee benefits, and overall competitiveness. , , a small American company that manufactures cuvettes and calibration standards for labs worldwide, is just one of countless businesses struggling to absorb these escalating expenses. Over the past few years, FireflySci has experienced annual increases exceeding , from its health insurance provider, United Healthcare Oxford.\u00a0,\n              ,\"This trend is simply unsustainable,\" said ,, spokesperson for FireflySci. \"We're doing everything we can to support our hardworking employees and keep their benefits intact, but health insurance premiums are skyrocketing at an overwhelming rate. It's creating an acute financial strain on businesses like ours, forcing impossible choices between investing in growth and taking care of our team.\",The impacts of these rising costs extend far beyond FireflySci. According to a survey by the Kaiser Family Foundation, health insurance costs for employers have increased significantly over the past decade, directly impacting the ability of small businesses to compete in a volatile economy. With limited resources, small businesses do not have the same negotiating power as large corporations when it comes to securing affordable insurance. This puts them at a distinct disadvantage, jeopardizing their viability and ability to attract and retain talented employees.,At FireflySci, the increased costs have required a reevaluation of , manufacturing budgets and benefits structures. \"Health insurance is one of the most important benefits we offer, and yet, we're now in a position where these rising premiums are eating into funds we would otherwise use to grow our business and support innovation,\" Woitovich explained. \"We simply cannot maintain this trajectory year after year without long-term consequences.\",The ripple effects of this crisis are profound. Across the country, other small businesses are facing similar struggles. Some are being forced to reduce coverage, push more costs onto employees, or even make painful cuts to their workforce. For many entrepreneurs, the dream of owning a small business is now tarnished by an uphill battle against unforgiving operating costs.,The consequences extend beyond small business owners and their employees to the broader U.S. economy. Small businesses employ nearly half of the country's private-sector workforce and contribute significantly to innovation and local development. However, rising operational costs driven by health insurance premiums threaten to stymie their growth and ability to compete.\u00a0,FireflySci is calling on policymakers to take immediate and meaningful action to address this crisis. By prioritizing healthcare reform and introducing measures to curb rising premiums, lawmakers can alleviate the burden on small businesses and help level the playing field.,\"As a nation, we need to find a solution that ensures affordable and accessible health care for Americans without placing an unbearable strain on small businesses,\" Sim urged. \"Our business owners and employees deserve better.\",Small businesses like , are the backbone of the American economy, and their voices cannot go unheard.

Accordingly, we ended the quarter with limited inventory of two completed, unsold homes per community, which was within our historical range.\",\"Reflecting continued weakness in the market, however, our average sales price, net of incentives, declined to ,, 1% lower than last year. Additionally, our gross margin was 18.7%, just shy of our guidance, and our SG&A expenses were 8.5%, producing a 10.2% net margin, all contributing to earnings of ,, or , per diluted share.\",\"Our first quarter was marked by a challenging macroeconomic environment for homebuilding. While demand remains strong, persistently higher interest rates and inflation, combined with a downturn in consumer confidence and a limited supply of affordable homes, made it increasingly difficult for consumers to access homeownership.,\"We continued to use incentives, including interest rate buydowns, to reconcile home prices to market conditions. These incentives bridged affordability to activate sales and manage inventory, while continuing to provide supply to the market. Generally speaking, net prices for homes, together with rents in overbuilt apartment markets, have started to decline, as demand remains constrained by affordability.\",\"During the quarter, we also constructively allocated capital, while we continued to strengthen and fortify our balance sheet. We repurchased , of our common stock, we distributed shares of Millrose to our shareholders and issued our regular dividend. We ended the quarter with no outstanding borrowings on our , revolving credit facility, cash of ,, and with homebuilding debt to total capital of 8.9%. Our balance sheet remains extremely strong.\",, Co-Chief Executive Officer and President of Lennar, said, \"Operationally, our starts pace and sales pace were 4.0 homes and 4.1 homes per community, respectively, in the first quarter, as we continue to move closer to an even flow operating model. Our cycle time was down to 137 days, or 11% lower year over year, as our production-first focus has positively impacted our production times, while our inventory turn improved to 1.7 times, compared to 1.5 last year, reflecting broader efficiencies.\",\"As we completed the migration to our land light strategy with the spin-off of Millrose during the first quarter, our years supply of owned homesites improved to 0.2 years from 1.3 years last year, and our controlled homesite percentage increased to 98% from 77% year over year, resulting in a return on inventory of 29.7%.\",Mr. Miller concluded, \"Despite an uncertain macro environment, we are optimistic about our business and remain focused on our mission of building a healthier housing market and bringing attainable homes to more people. As we look ahead, we expect to deliver between 19,500 to 20,500 homes for the second quarter and expect our gross margin to be approximately 18%, depending on market conditions.

As a percentage of revenues from home sales, selling, general and administrative expenses increased to 8.5% in the first quarter of 2025, from 8.2% in the first quarter of 2024, primarily due to an increase in marketing and selling expenses.,Operating earnings for the Financial Services segment were , in the first quarter of 2025, compared to , in the first quarter of 2024.

This distribution amount represents a tax-equivalent rate of 7.99% and an annualized rate of 5.25%, based on the current share price. Since inception in 2012 at a , NAV per share, TIPRX has paid approximately , per share in total distributions to its shareholders. This represents over 75% return on the Fund's initial shareholders' principal investment before distribution reinvestment.,\"We are proud to have delivered 49 consecutive quarterly distributions, reflecting over 12 years of steady income for our shareholders,\" said ,, CEO of Bluerock Capital Markets. \"We believe that the powerful cyclical market dynamics emerging in private institutional real estate, coupled with the Fund's allocation to our highest conviction, high growth sectors, are setting up a strong multi-year bull run. Additionally, we believe that the Fund's access to alpha-generating special situations real estate investments through our strategic partnership with The\u00a0Townsend Group, with over , in advised and managed assets, will be a key differentiated return driver for TI+ in 2025 and the years ahead.\",Since inception, TI+ has delivered on its stated objectives, including generating current income and capital appreciation as well as maintaining low correlation and low volatility relative to the broader markets.,Net assets under management for TI+ are approximately , as of ,. TI+ currently maintains positions in 31 private equity and 6 private debt real estate investments, with underlying assets valued at approximately , (holdings are subject to change at any time and should not be considered investment advice).,(Actual distribution rate was 5.25% annualized for the most recent period. As of the most recent Section 19a notice, the amount of distribution attributable to return of capital (ROC) was 100%),For detailed Fund holdings, please visit ,Returns presented are total net return:\u00a0Expressed in percentage terms, the calculation of total return is determined by taking the change in price, reinvesting, if applicable, all income and capital gains distributions during the period, and dividing by the starting price. Returns greater than one year are annualized.,The tax-equivalent distribution rate is the rate a fully taxable investment needs in order to equal the after-tax rate on a comparable tax-advantaged investment. The example assumes 37% maximum federal income tax rate and includes the 3.8% Medicare surtax that is applied to the net investment income above certain thresholds. It does not include state taxes. 76% was the calendar year return of capital (\"ROC\") and non-dividend distribution portion of distributions in 2024. ROC, for tax purposes, should be distinguished from an economic return of capital, where an investor is repaid out of its own contributions rather than from the economic profits of the investment. As a tax law concept, an ROC is not tied to an investment's financial performance. ROC distributions reduce the stockholder's tax basis in the year the dividend is received. The stockholder's tax basis may be reduced by ROC distributions in the year the distribution is received and generally defer taxes on that portion until the stockholder's stock is sold via repurchase. Upon repurchase, the investor will calculate their gain by reference to the lower cost basis attributable to the ROC distributions, which gain may be subject to tax at capital gain rates. Actual distribution rate was 5.25% annualized for the period. The Fund's distribution policy is to make quarterly distributions to shareholders. The level of quarterly distributions (including any return of capital) is not fixed. However, this distribution policy is subject to change. The Fund's distribution amounts were calculated based on the ordinary income received from the underlying investments, including short-term capital gains realized from the disposition of such investments. Shareholders should not assume that the source of a distribution from the Fund is net profit. All or a portion of the distributions consist of a return of capital based on the character of the distributions received from the underlying holdings, primarily Real Estate Investment Trusts. The final determination of the source and tax characteristics of all distributions will be made after the end of the year. Shareholders should note that return of capital will reduce the tax basis of their shares and potentially increase the taxable gain, if any, upon disposition of their shares. There is no assurance that the Company will continue to declare distributions or that they will continue at these rates.,\u00a0For detailed Fund holdings, please visit , Inception date of the Fund is ,\u00a0The maximum sales charge for the Class A shares is 5.75%. Investors may be eligible for a waiver or a reduction in the sales charge.,\u00a0,The total annual fund operating expense ratio, gross of any fee waivers or expense reimbursements, is 3.34% for Class A, 4.07% for Class C, 3.10% for Class I, 3.59% for Class L, and 3.82% for Class M.

Nearly 40 million Americans suffer from kidney disease, and the kidney stakeholder community uses March and April to drive public awareness of the unmet need for earlier kidney disease detection and greater living kidney donation. People living with kidney failure on dialysis have a mortality rate of over 50 percent within the first five years of treatment. As reported by ,, Behar made her callous remarks of making kidney donation contingent upon the political beliefs of the recipient during a segment of , aired on , (,).,The , report said, \"Since\u00a0,'s election in November,\u00a0,\u00a0has been one of the most vocal critics of his policies and the supporters who chose him to implement them. Each day on\u00a0,, she has some of the harshest critiques for the current administration and is always ready with a zinger on the 'Hot Topics' related to it. So, when asked on Thursday's (,) episode whether she could ever be friends with a Trump supporter, her answer was similarly spirited. 'I won't give them a kidney, but I could be friends with a Trump supporter,' she said before explaining her reasoning. 'I mean, the thing about it is, it's not just about politics. It's about morality, ethics, it's about cruelty, it's about discrimination. So those are personal, human values. We're not really just talking about a fiscal conservative [issue of] who pays more taxes. We're talking about you as a human being. So it's hard to be friends with someone who signs on to something like that.'\",In response, AAKP issued the following formal statement:,Since 2018, AAKP has conducted the largest nonpartisan voter registration drive in , for kidney patients and organ donors and, in 2024, exceeded its goal of engaging over 500,000 KidneyVoters\u2122. \u00a0AAKP was founded in 1969 by six individuals living on dialysis at Queens County Hospital in ,. These patients organized and then advocated before Congress to make the same life-saving treatment they received available to every other American living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure. After one of AAKP's patient founders dialyzed in front of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee in the early 1970s, a bipartisan Congress and President , worked together to establish modern dialysis and transplant coverage for every American suffering from kidney failure. Unlike communist ,, America has never made dialysis or access to life-saving organ transplants contingent upon a person's spiritual practices or political beliefs.,Over the past decade, AAKP patient members and advocates have helped advance the passage of the bipartisan law modernizing the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) via greater competition and oversight (2023); lifetime transplant drug coverage for kidney transplant recipients (2020); contributed patient insights and lived experiences to inform President Trump's ,(2019); supported new job protections for living organ donors under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) via the U.S. Department of Labor (2018); and advocated for Congressional legislation allowing HIV-positive organ transplants for HIV-positive patients (2013).,\u00a0Follow AAKP on social media at @kidneypatient on Facebook, @kidneypatients on X, and @kidneypatients on Instagram, and visit\u00a0,\u00a0for more information.,SOURCE American Association of Kidney Patients,As the largest and oldest fully independent kidney patient organization in the United States, the American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP)...,The American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP), the largest and oldest independent kidney patient organization in the United States, today issued ...",

        ", , /PRNewswire/ --\u00a0,, one of the world's best-selling and leading technology companies, today announced the next Precise Dimming Series in its 2025 TV lineup - the new QM7K. Following the successful launch of its QM6K at the Consumer Electronics Show in January, the QM7K is TCL's second series to feature its new Halo Control System. Delivering a complete 2025 Mini LED system upgrade for stunning picture accuracy, the Halo Control System\u00a0features a suite of advanced technologies throughout the QM7K premium QD-Mini LED lineup in TCL's widest range of sizes \u2013 from a sharp 55\" screen all the way up to a jaw-dropping 115\" screen size for the ultimate entertainment immersion experience.,\"TCL is not only a top 2 best-selling TV brand, we entered 2025 as the fastest growing TV brand in America, as awarded by Circana, and we don't plan on slowing down any time soon. We are a leading player in the electronics industry, and our world class innovation is revolutionizing the way we apply picture technology and the benefits we bring consumers,\" said ,, Executive Vice President, TCL North America. \"TCL's QM7 was the biggest star in our portfolio last year, with some of the best-selling skus in the U.S., so we're proud of this latest version that pushes the boundaries of QLED, QD-Mini LED and XXL screens. While only the second entry in our Precise Dimming Series, the QM7K is a testament to the premium quality and unprecedented value TCL is known for.\",TCL introduced the world's first big-screen Quantum Dot TV, developed its own powerful TCL AiPQ Processor and introduced the world's first Mini LED TV, all to critical acclaim because the entire line of high-quality products is accessible to consumers. The award-winning QD-Mini LED models stem from TCL's Pangu Lab - the world's first full process Mini LED development center and the only one of its kind in , - where experts perform all stages of Mini LED backlight development from concept and R&D to design and materials, as well as component creation, and full system trial production. The TCL Pangu Lab's dedication to advancing QD-Mini LED technology is achieved in\u00a0the QM7K's dramatically improved picture performance.,Armed with truly next gen Mini LED technology, the TCL QM7K offers higher peak brightness than its predecessor QM751G for even greater HDR impact.\u00a0TCL's latest Precise Dimming Series also sports a new CrystGlow HVA Panel (anti-reflective), premium audio by Bang & Olufsen, and an elegant pedestal stand on select sizes, but the Halo Control System is truly what sets it apart from the competition.,The Halo Control System yields three key benefits including enhanced color accuracy, gray scale accuracy, as well as virtually no blooming, for more natural, stunning picture quality. The new system's\u00a0Super High Energy LED Chip combines high brightness with increased light efficiency while a Super Condensed Micro Lens uses a narrower light path for more precise light control. Additionally, the\u00a0new TCL Micro OD reduces optical distance between the backlight and diffuser plate for virtually no blooming or halo effect and avoids LED light overlap\u00a0to produce clear, sharp edges between bright whites and dark blacks.,TCL's enhanced QD-Mini LED backlight technology works in conjunction with a high contrast HVA Panel to block out more of the light when the LCD closes for better dark state, providing up to 5X native contrast. Furthermore, enhanced QLED technology combines a new Color Optimization Algorithm with more vibrant Quantum Crystals for significantly improved color accuracy.,Critical to achieve premium picture quality, processing also gets an upgrade in the TCL QM7K with Zero-Delay Transient Response for virtually no lag between the input signal and backlight response, preventing after-image blur and maximizing specular highlights. The Halo Control System also adds a Bi-directional 23-bit Backlight Controller, allowing the finest granular control of over 65,000 levels of brightness for each LED so gray scale accuracy is elevated. In addition, the system includes a Dynamic Light Algorithm (DLA) that intelligently optimizes the incoming video to render SDR signals at near HDR level, for consistently pristine picture quality regardless of the content metadata.,\"Our first Precise Dimming Series with the new Halo Control System, the QM6K, stunned reviewers with its amazing leap in picture accuracy,\" said ,, VP, Product Marketing and Development, Home Theater. \"With the new QM7K Series, we continue that extraordinary picture accuracy but then add a demonstrable step above in HDR Impact. Plus, with the new premium Audio by Bang & Olufsen, we complement the picture with noticeably more accurate home theater sound. The TCL QM7K series is available in a wide variety of screen sizes to suit any home environment but now includes the XXL 115\" for those ready to build a truly impressive home theater.\",TCL's QM7K series replaces the award-winning QM751G from 2024 and offers:,The new TCL QM7K is available at retailers nationwide in a 55\" for , MSRP, 65\" for , MSRP, 75\" for , MSRP, 85\" for , MSRP, as well as XXL big screens in 98\" for , MSRP and 115\" for , MSRP coming soon.

        ", , /PRNewswire/ - WildBrain, a global leader in kids' and family entertainment, has launched the results of new research which highlights the evolving content-viewing habits of US families. The new research, titled \"The Connected Family: Screentime is Bonding Time,\" was commissioned by WildBrain and conducted by leading research company Savanta. It explores the perceptions and preferences of US families around the content they watch and games they play, as well as the value for families of watching and gaming together as bonding activities, and how families recognize and engage with the brands they see.,\n              ,The research, which surveyed approximately 2,100 parents and children in the US*, points to the shared experience of watching content with their children as an activity parents value as a key part of family life. In fact, the research shows that families rate watching content together to be their third-most important bonding activity after only mealtime and travelling together, and ahead of experiences like sports, arts and crafts, theme parks, concerts, museums, and shopping. Family viewing is especially important to younger parents, the majority of whom (71% Gen Z and 61% Millennials) watch content together with their kids at least once a day, while Gen X parents (49%) appreciate that it provides a low-effort way to bond with their children. The findings also show that family viewing goes beyond just having videos play in the background, with the majority of parents (89%) actively watching the same screen or device as their children.,Parents also expressed that nostalgia and familiarity are key drivers in decision making when choosing which content to watch. Parents enjoy sharing shows and movies from their own childhood with their kids, creating a sense of continuity and shared family history. Parents and children also have equal input when it comes to choosing what to watch, but both understand that parents have the final say. The data shows that parents look for content that is age-appropriate, family-friendly, educational, and conducive to the bonding experience.,In gaming, the research shows that Roblox is the top choice for families\u2014it provides opportunities for bonding through interactive play and is entertaining while also offering educational value. It is also a game that benefits from character familiarity and brand crossover, leading to stronger affiliation. Roblox is the top platform for kids (69%), followed by Minecraft (63%), and Fortnite (55%). Kids aged 9-12 are the most active Roblox players (76% using the platform), while teens aged 13-15 are the most active users on Fortnite (65%).,Children aged 6-15 trust YouTube the most to tell them what video games to play, while YouTube is the primary destination for watching gaming-based content. More than 70% of children like to see their favorite video and gaming characters on YouTube.,The research further shows that brands looking to engage with parents and kids should adopt cross-platform brand-integration strategies that contemplate leveraging the reach of YouTube, gaming, FAST, and AVOD. The data demonstrates great interest among children in interacting with their favorite characters across new formats and platforms, be it gaming characters in shows, or vice versa. In particular, children enjoy dressing their avatars in character-related costumes or by playing as part of their favorite characters' teams. This interest also extends to parents, with 8 out of 10 stating they would like to see new platform-character crossovers. In particular, brand integrations on gaming platforms are effective in influencing family purchases, especially for entertainment and food.,This important family time presents key opportunities for brands to reach parents. The data demonstrates that, in general, parents and children are comfortable with watching informative or entertaining brand promotions. The majority of parents (71%) have made purchases in the past based on brands they have seen when watching video content or gaming with their child, and two-thirds of children have asked their parents to buy them a toy or game after seeing a real-life brand in a video game.,, VP Media Solutions at WildBrain, said: \"Building off our research from last year, it's striking to see in our new research just how important content-viewing and gaming time have become to families. Screentime isn't just for babysitting anymore\u2014it has become an important bonding experience, and parents are just as engaged in what's on the screen as their kids, presenting a unique opportunity for brands to engage audiences and generate interest.,\"Nostalgia as a key decision-driver for parents speaks directly to WildBrain's core capabilities. Our expansive presence across platforms offers COPPA- and CARU-compliant opportunities to reach parents and engage families.

The 2024 financial information included in this press release contains only part of the 2024 financial statements which will be included in the 2024 Annual Report and which still must be adopted by the shareholders at the upcoming Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The 2024 Annual Report has not yet been published and an auditors' opinion has not yet been issued.,In this press release, UMG presents certain financial measures when discussing UMG's performance that are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS (\"non-IFRS\"). These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance, profitability, financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as presented in UMG's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes, or as described in this press release. In addition, it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG, thereby affecting comparability.,UMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin, non-IFRS measures, to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses, which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue.,To calculate EBITDA, the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the Operating Profit:,The difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items when applicable, that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.,UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-IFRS measures, to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity and excluding non-cash share based compensation which may impact period-to-period comparability.,UMG's use of Adjusted net profit is appropriate as UMG uses it as the basis for the Adjusted net profit per share (in EUR) \u2013 diluted, both of which are non-IFRS measures. Adjusted net profit may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes certain items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items, which may be significant and have a significant effect on UMG's net profit. During 2024, UMG updated the definition of Adjusted net profit to exclude restructuring expenses which may impact period-to-period comparability.,The accounting impact of the following items are excluded from Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent:,UMG considers Financial Net Debt, a non-IFRS measure, to be a relevant indicator of its liquidity and capital resources. UMG management uses this indicator for reporting, management and planning purposes. Financial Net Debt is calculated as the sum of:,less:,UMG defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities plus net cash provided by/(used for) investing activities, less repayment of lease liabilities, interest paid, net and other cash items related to financing activities. UMG considers Free Cash Flow, a non-IFRS measure, to be a relevant indicator of its cash flow generated to fund dividend payments and repayment of debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with IFRS and therefore it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.,SOURCE Universal Music Group N.V.,Universal Music Group N.V.

Although UMG believes that such forward-looking statements are based on reasonable assumptions, they are not guarantees of future performance. Actual results may differ materially from such forward-looking statements as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties, many of which are related to factors that are outside UMG's control, including, but not limited to, UMG's inability to compete successfully and to identify, attract, sign and retain successful recording artists and songwriters, failure of streaming and subscription adoption or revenue to grow or to grow less rapidly than anticipated, UMG's reliance on digital service providers, UMG's inability to execute its business strategy, the global nature of UMG's operations, changes in global economic and financial conditions, UMG's inability to protect its intellectual property and against piracy, challenges related to generative AI, UMG's inability to attract and retain key personnel, UMG's restructuring and reorganization activities, UMG's acquisitions and other investments, changes in laws and regulations (and UMG's compliance therewith) and the other risks that are described in our 2023 Annual Report and that will be described in our 2024 Annual Report.

The 2024 financial information included in this press release contains only part of the 2024 financial statements which will be included in the 2024 Annual Report and which still must be adopted by the shareholders at the upcoming Annual General Meeting of Shareholders. The 2024 Annual Report has not yet been published and an auditors' opinion has not yet been issued.,In this press release, UMG presents certain financial measures when discussing UMG's performance that are not measures of financial performance or liquidity under IFRS (\"non-IFRS\"). These non-IFRS measures (also known as alternative performance indicators) are presented because management considers them important supplemental measures of UMG's performance and believes that they are widely used in the industry in which UMG operates as a means of evaluating a company's operating performance and liquidity. UMG believes that an understanding of its sales performance, profitability, financial strength and funding requirements is enhanced by reporting the following non-IFRS measures. All non-IFRS measures should be considered in addition to, and not as a substitute for, other IFRS measures of operating and financial performance as presented in UMG's Consolidated Financial Statements and the related Notes, or as described in this press release. In addition, it should be noted that other companies may have definitions and calculations for these non-IFRS measures that differ from those used by UMG, thereby affecting comparability.,UMG considers EBITDA and EBITDA margin, non-IFRS measures, to be relevant measures to assess its operating performance and the performance of its operating segments as reported in the segment data. It enables UMG to compare the operating performance of operating segments regardless of whether their performance is driven by the operating segment's organic growth or by acquisitions. It excludes restructuring expenses, which may impact period-to-period comparability. EBITDA margin is EBITDA divided by revenue.,To calculate EBITDA, the accounting impact of the following items is excluded from the Operating Profit:,The difference between EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA consists of non-cash share-based compensation expenses and certain one-time items when applicable, that are deemed by management to be significant and incidental to normal business activity. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue.,UMG considers Adjusted EBITDA and Adjusted EBITDA margin, non-IFRS measures, to be relevant measures to assess performance of its operating activities excluding items that may be incidental to normal business activity and excluding non-cash share based compensation which may impact period-to-period comparability.,UMG's use of Adjusted net profit is appropriate as UMG uses it as the basis for the Adjusted net profit per share (in EUR) \u2013 diluted, both of which are non-IFRS measures. Adjusted net profit may be subject to limitations as an analytical tool for investors, as it excludes certain items and therefore does not reflect the expense associated with such items, which may be significant and have a significant effect on UMG's net profit. During 2024, UMG updated the definition of Adjusted net profit to exclude restructuring expenses which may impact period-to-period comparability.,The accounting impact of the following items are excluded from Net profit attributable to equity holders of the parent:,UMG considers Financial Net Debt, a non-IFRS measure, to be a relevant indicator of its liquidity and capital resources. UMG management uses this indicator for reporting, management and planning purposes. Financial Net Debt is calculated as the sum of:,less:,UMG defines Free Cash Flow as net cash provided by/(used for) operating activities plus net cash provided by/(used for) investing activities, less repayment of lease liabilities, interest paid, net and other cash items related to financing activities. UMG considers Free Cash Flow, a non-IFRS measure, to be a relevant indicator of its cash flow generated to fund dividend payments and repayment of debt. Free Cash Flow is not a measure of performance calculated in accordance with IFRS and therefore it should not be considered in isolation of, or as a substitute for cash flow provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity. Free Cash Flow, as we calculate it, may not be comparable to similarly titled measures employed by other companies. In addition, Free Cash Flow does not necessarily represent funds available for discretionary use and is not necessarily a measure of our ability to fund our cash needs.,Logo - ,Universal Music Group N.V.

Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of ,.,The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of supply executives in the services sector based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM, makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.,The , (formerly the Non-Manufacturing ISM,) is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. Membership of the Services Business Survey Panel (formerly Non-Manufacturing Business Survey Committee) is diversified by NAICS, based on each industry's contribution to gross domestic product (GDP). The Services Business Survey Panel responses are divided into the following NAICS code categories: Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing & Hunting; Mining; Utilities; Construction; Wholesale Trade; Retail Trade; Transportation & Warehousing; Information; Finance & Insurance; Real Estate, Rental & Leasing; Professional, Scientific & Technical Services; Management of Companies & Support Services; Educational Services; Health Care & Social Assistance; Arts, Entertainment & Recreation; Accommodation & Food Services; Public Administration; and Other Services (services such as Equipment & Machinery Repairing; Promoting or Administering Religious Activities; Grantmaking; Advocacy; and Providing Dry-Cleaning & Laundry Services, Personal Care Services, Death Care Services, Pet Care Services, Photofinishing Services, Temporary Parking Services, and Dating Services).

We love to film but we have never had anything captured this perfectly before.\",What unites these couples is their desire to educate and inspire those curious about this way of life.

However, there are no assurances that the Company will be able to regain or maintain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement or any other Nasdaq listing standards, that Nasdaq will grant the Company any extension of time to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Price Requirement, or that any such appeal to the Panel will be successful, as applicable.,This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the safe harbor provisions of the U.S. Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

A lead plaintiff is a representative party acting on behalf of other class members in directing the litigation.,Why Rosen Law:\u00a0We encourage investors to select qualified counsel with a track record of success in leadership roles. Often, firms issuing notices do not have comparable experience, resources, or any meaningful peer recognition.

The negative effects of the Campaign on Target's business, including a subsequent campaign in 2024 (the \"2024 Campaign\"), led to a massive decline in Target's stock price.,Specifically, the Campaign offended certain Target customers, provoking consumer backlash and boycotts that caused Target's sales to fall for the first time in six years. Unbeknownst to investors, and contrary to Target's public statements, its Chief Executive Officer (\"CEO\") and Board of directors did not oversee or disclose the known risks of Target's 2023 or 2024 Campaigns. This deceit, through misleading statements in Target's public filings, caused Target investors to purchase Target stock at artificially inflated prices.

Die BPDCN zeigt typischerweise Hautl\u00e4sionen und kann auch Knochenmark, Blut, das zentrale Nervensystem, Lymphknoten und Eingeweide betreffen. Die Ursprungszelle der BPDCN ist der Vorl\u00e4ufer der plasmazytoiden dendritischen Zellen (pDC). Die Diagnose von BPDCN basiert auf der immunph\u00e4notypischen diagnostischen Trias von CD123, CD4 und CD56 sowie anderen Markern.

The overall economy continued in expansion for the 58th month after one month of contraction in ,. (A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.3 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.) The New Orders Index dropped back into contraction territory after expanding for three months, registering 48.6 percent, 6.5 percentage points lower than the 55.1 percent recorded in January. The February reading of the Production Index (50.7 percent) is 1.8 percentage points lower than January's figure of 52.5 percent. The index expanded for the second month in a row after eight months in contraction. The Prices Index surged further into expansion (or 'increasing') territory, registering 62.4 percent, up 7.5 percentage points compared to the reading of 54.9 percent in January. The Backlog of Orders Index registered 46.8 percent, up 1.9 percentage points compared to the 44.9 percent recorded in January. The Employment Index registered 47.6 percent, down 2.7 percentage points from January's figure of 50.3 percent.,\"The Supplier Deliveries Index indicated further slowing deliveries, registering 54.5 percent, 3.6 percentage points higher than the 50.9 percent recorded in January. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM, ,\u00a0index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Inventories Index registered 49.9 percent, up 4 percentage points compared to January's reading of 45.9 percent.,\"The New Export Orders Index reading of 51.4 percent is 1 percentage point lower than the reading of 52.4 percent registered in January. The Imports Index continued in expansion in February, registering 52.6 percent, 1.5 percentage points higher than January's reading of 51.1 percent.\",Fiore continues, \"U.S. manufacturing activity expanded marginally for the second month in a row in February after 26 consecutive months of contraction. Demand weakened, while output stabilized and inputs, for the first time in several months, contributed to PMI, growth. Indications that , weakened include: the (1) New Orders Index dropped into contraction territory, (2) New Export Orders Index continued expanding, but at a slower rate, (3) Backlog of Orders Index continued in contraction, but moved upward, and (4) Customers' Inventories Index moved further into 'too low' territory. ,\u00a0(measured by the Production and Employment indexes) was stable. Factory output marginally expanded compared to January, indicating that panelists' companies are being cautious about ramping up output in the face of economic headwinds. The Employment Index moved back into contraction, as panelists' companies continued to release workers. More companies cited 'attriting down' as the best process, with destaffing not as urgent as it was in the second half of 2024. , \u2014 defined as supplier deliveries, inventories, prices and imports \u2014 revealed the first signs of supplier difficulties\u00a0due to some pull-forward deliveries and discussions about who will pay for tariffs.\u00a0Inventories recovered somewhat as a result.,\"Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists' companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration's tariff policy.\u00a0Prices growth accelerated due to tariffs, causing new order placement backlogs, supplier delivery stoppages and manufacturing inventory impacts. Although tariffs do not go into force until mid-March, spot commodity prices have already risen about 20 percent. Twenty-four percent of manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in February, down from 43 percent in January. The share of manufacturing sector GDP registering a composite PMI, calculation at or below 45 percent (a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness) was 2 percent in February, a 6-percentage point improvement compared to the 8 percent reported in January. Of the six largest manufacturing industries, four (Petroleum & Coal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment) expanded in February, equaling the number in January,\" says Fiore.,The 10 manufacturing industries reporting growth in February \u2014 listed in order \u2014 are: Petroleum & Coal Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; Wood Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Fabricated Metal Products; and Transportation Equipment. The five industries reporting contraction in February are: Furniture & Related Products; Textile Mills; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Machinery., data is seasonally adjusted for the New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories indexes.,*Number of months moving in current direction.,Aluminum (15); Cocoa Beans; Copper; Electrical Components; Electronic Components; Labor \u2014 Temporary; Natural Gas (5); Plastic Resin; Polypropylene Resin; Solvents; Steel; Steel \u2014 Carbon; Steel \u2014 Hot Rolled; and Steel \u2014 Scrap (2).,Ocean Freight.,Electrical Components (53).,Note: The number of consecutive months the commodity is listed is indicated after each item.,The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded for the second consecutive month in February after 26 months of contraction, as the Manufacturing PMI, registered 50.3 percent, 0.6 percentage point lower compared to the 50.9 percent reported in January. \"Although the PMI, took a step back in February, it increased by four percentage points over the three previous months, with the most recent bump in January finally returning the manufacturing sector to expansion. Of the five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI,, two (Production and Supplier Deliveries) were in expansion territory, compared to four in January. Both the Employment and the New Orders indexes returned to contraction.\u00a0Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, four (Petroleum & Coal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment) registered growth,\" says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.,A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.3 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.\u00a0Therefore, the February Manufacturing PMI, indicates the overall economy grew for the 58th straight month after last contracting in ,. \"The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI, and the overall economy indicates that the February\u00a0reading (50.3 percent) corresponds to a change of plus-2.2 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,\" says Fiore.,ISM,'s New Orders Index contracted in February after expanding for three consecutive months, registering 48.6 percent, a decrease of 6.5 percentage points compared to January's figure of 55.1 percent. This is the steepest single-month decline since ,, when the index dropped 15.1 percentage points. The New Orders Index hasn't indicated consistent growth since a 24-month streak of expansion ended in ,. \"Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, four (Petroleum & Coal Products; Machinery; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products) reported increased new orders. The other two, Computer & Electronic Products; and Transportation Equipment, reported declines. Panelists noted a weakening level of demand performance, with a 1.3-to-1 ratio of positive comments versus those expressing concern about near-term demand. Orders have also been impacted by discussions of which party will pay for potential tariff costs, causing a slowing in order placement. In addition, there is diminished confidence not only in additional interest rate cuts, but also the decline in long-term rates affecting durable goods and construction activity,\" says Fiore. A New Orders Index above 52.1\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders (in constant ,).,The nine manufacturing industries that reported growth in new orders in February, in order, are: Petroleum & Coal Products; Wood Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; Machinery; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products.\u00a0The six industries reporting a decline in new orders in February, in order, are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; Furniture & Related Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Transportation Equipment.,The Production Index was in expansion territory in February for the second straight month, registering 50.7 percent, 1.8\u00a0percentage points lower than the January\u00a0reading of 52.5 percent. Prior to January's reading, the index was in contraction territory for eight consecutive months. Prior to the last two months, the last time the index registered above 50 percent was in , (50.7 percent). Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, three (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment)\u00a0reported increased production. \"Production levels in February were similar to January's performance, as order books remain weak and new orders remain elusive,\" says Fiore. An index above\u00a052.1 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures.,The seven industries reporting growth in production during the month of February, in order, are: Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Plastics & Rubber Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment. The four industries reporting a decrease in production in February are: Textile Mills; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; and Machinery. Six industries reported no change in production levels in February as compared to January.,ISM,'s Employment Index registered 47.6 percent in February, 2.7 percentage points lower than January's reading of 50.3 percent. \"The index has returned to contraction after expanding for a single month. Since ,, the Employment Index has contracted 27 of the last 34 months. Of the six big manufacturing sectors, only one (Transportation Equipment) expanded employment in February. Respondents' companies are continuing to reduce head counts through layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes. This action is supported by a second straight month with an approximate 1-to-1 ratio of hiring versus staff-reduction comments. Panelists are continuing to release employees as the business environment becomes more unclear,\" says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.3\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the six industries reporting employment growth in February \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Plastics & Rubber Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; and Transportation Equipment. The nine industries reporting a decrease in employment in February, in the following order, are: Textile Mills; Furniture & Related Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Primary Metals; Machinery; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Computer & Electronic Products.,Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was slower in February, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 54.5 percent, a 3.6-percentage point increase compared to the reading of 50.9 percent reported in January. This expansion follows a contraction (which indicates faster delivery performance) in November, preceded by four consecutive months of slower deliveries, with four straight months of faster deliveries before that. After a reading of 52.4 percent in ,, the index went into contraction territory the following month and remained there for 20 out of 21 months, with , the exception. Of the six big industries, five (Petroleum & Coal Products; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported slower supplier deliveries in February. \"Supplier deliveries moved further into 'slower' territory, as suppliers struggled to meet accelerated delivery requests from customers (due to a potential ports strike and tariffs deployment) and as suppliers and panelists' companies negotiate who pays for current tariffs, resulting in the slowing of some material deliveries,\" says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.,The nine manufacturing industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in February \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are:\u00a0Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Textile Mills; Petroleum & Coal Products; Primary Metals; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Computer & Electronic Products. The four industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in February are: Furniture & Related Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Machinery; and Fabricated Metal Products.,The Inventories Index registered 49.9 percent\u00a0in February, up a notable 4 percentage points compared to the reading of\u00a045.9 percent reported in January. The last time the Inventories Index registered above 50 percent was in August, when it registered 50.2 percent. \"Manufacturing inventories marginally contracted in February, as panelists' companies are asking for earlier deliveries of materials due to a potential ports work stoppage and the financial impacts of tariffs deployment,\" says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.5\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained ,).,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the seven industries reporting higher inventories in February \u2014 listed in order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Petroleum & Coal Products; Furniture & Related Products; Paper Products; Primary Metals; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products. The six industries reporting lower inventories in February \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Wood Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Machinery; Fabricated Metal Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Computer & Electronic Products.,ISM,'s Customers' Inventories Index registered a reading of 45.3 percent in February, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the reading of 46.7 percent in January. \"Customers' inventory levels in February dropped into definitive 'too low' territory. Panelists are reporting that the amounts of their companies' products in their customers' inventories suggest a demand level that is positive for future production,\" says Fiore.,The two industries reporting customers' inventories as too high in February are: Wood Products; and Transportation Equipment.\u00a0The 10 industries reporting customers' inventories as too low in February, in order, are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Primary Metals; Computer & Electronic Products; Machinery; Chemical Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components.,\u00a0,\u00a0,The ISM, Prices Index registered 62.4 percent\u00a0in February, 7.5\u00a0percentage points higher compared to the January\u00a0reading of 54.9 percent,\u00a0indicating raw materials prices increased for the fifth straight month after a decrease in September.\u00a0This is the largest month-over-month increase in the Prices Index since an increase of 7.7 percentage points in ,; there was an 11.5-percentage point gain in ,. Of the six largest manufacturing industries, five \u2014 Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Computer & Electronic Products\u00a0\u2014 reported price increases in February. \"The Prices Index indicated increasing prices in February for the fifth consecutive month, driven by the dramatic increase in commodity prices as a result of new and potential tariffs. Mill materials (steel, aluminum and copper), food elements, plastics and natural gas registered increases similar to the prior month. The plastics increase reversed a decline. Thirty-one percent of companies reported higher prices in February, compared to 21 percent in January,\" says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.8\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.,In February, the 14 industries that reported paying increased prices for raw materials, in order, are: Wood Products; Textile Mills; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; Furniture & Related Products; Paper Products; and Computer & Electronic Products.\u00a0The only industry that reported paying decreased prices for raw materials in February is Petroleum & Coal Products.,ISM,'s Backlog of Orders Index registered 46.8 percent, an increase of 1.9 percentage points compared to the January reading of 44.9 percent, indicating order backlogs contracted for the 29th consecutive month after a 27-month period of expansion. None of the six largest manufacturing industries reported expanded order backlogs in February. \"It appears that the extensive decline in order books has dramatically slowed, indicated by three months at moderate rather than significant contraction.

The average lead time in February for Production Materials was 85 days, an increase of two days compared to January. The average lead time for Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies was 45 days, a decrease of two days compared to January.,DO NOT CONFUSE THIS NATIONAL REPORT with the various regional purchasing reports released across the country. The national report's information reflects the entire U.S., while the regional reports contain primarily regional data from their local vicinities. Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of ,.,The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing supply executives\u00a0based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM, makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data\u00a0should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.,The , is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The composition of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is stratified according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and each of the following NAICS-based industries' contribution to gross domestic product (GDP): Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Petroleum & Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture & Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies). The data is weighted based on each industry's contribution to GDP. According to BEA estimates (the average of the fourth quarter 2023 GDP estimate and the GDP estimates for first, second, and third quarter 2024, as released on ,), the six largest manufacturing industries are: Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Petroleum & Coal Products.,Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For nine indicators (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Employment, and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. For Customers' Inventories, respondents report their assessment of their customers' stock levels of respondent companies' products this month (rather than last month): too high, about right, and too low. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive).,The resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (Manufacturing PMI,, New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The Manufacturing PMI, is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders\u00a0(seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries,\u00a0and Inventories (seasonally adjusted).,Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A Manufacturing PMI, reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0above 42.3\u00a0percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 42.3 percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 42.3\u00a0percent is indicative of the extent of the expansion or decline.\u00a0With some of the indicators within this report, ISM, has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis. For the Customers' Inventories Index, numerically, a reading: above 50 percent is \"too high,\" equal to 50 percent is \"about right,\" and below 50 percent is \"too low.\" However, in practice and in the context of other data, customers' inventories may be considered to be \"about right\" if the diffusion index is between 52 percent (the high side of about right) and 48 percent (the low side of about right).,The , survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to report on information for the current month for U.S. operations only. ISM, receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM, then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month.,The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the , , monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.,Responses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Capital Expenditures; Production Materials; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days.

In a year that promises an unusual degree of change and uncertainty, ,helps you see around the corner and work out what might be coming next.\",In its 39th year, ,edition discusses a broad range of topics, but its top ten themes for 2025, distilled from its pages, are as follows:,\u00a0The repercussions of Mr Trump's sweeping victory will affect everything from immigration and defence to economics and trade. His \",\" policy will have friends and foes alike questioning the solidity of America's alliances. This could lead to geopolitical realignments, heightened tensions and even nuclear proliferation.,\u00a0More generally, incumbent parties did badly in 2024's unprecedented wave of elections. Some were chucked out (as in America and ,); others were forced into coalition (as in , and ,); others were pushed into cohabitation (as in , and ,). So 2025 will be a year of expectations. Can new leaders deliver what they promised? Will humbled leaders change? If not, unrest may follow.,\u00a0Mr Trump may push , to do a deal with , and give , a free hand in its conflicts in , and ,. America's more transactional stance and scepticism of foreign entanglements will encourage troublemaking by ,, ,, , and , (the \"quartet of chaos\") and more meddling by regional powers, like that seen in crisis-hit ,. But it is unclear whether America would stand up to , in a conflict over , or in the South China Sea.,\u00a0For now, America's rivalry with , will manifest itself as a trade war, as Mr Trump imposes restrictions and ramps up tariffs\u2014including on America's allies. As protectionism intensifies, Chinese firms are expanding abroad, both to get around trade barriers and to tap new markets in the global south. So much for decoupling; Chinese firms, building factories from , to ,, have other plans.,\u00a0China's government has encouraged booming exports of solar panels, batteries and electric vehicles to offset a weak domestic economy. The result is a Chinese-led cleantech boom, with adoption of solar panels and grid storage outstripping forecasts. And the world will soon learn whether global emissions have peaked.,\u00a0The rich world's central bankers have celebrated the defeat of inflation. Now Western economies face a new challenge: reducing deficits, by increasing taxes, cutting spending or boosting growth. Many may also have to increase defence budgets. Painful economic choices loom. In America, Mr Trump's policies will make things worse: hefty import tariffs could hamper growth and reignite inflation.,\u00a0America has just picked its oldest-ever president-elect. World leaders are greying, along with their populations. Expect more discussion of age limits for political leaders. ,, meanwhile, is looking for economic opportunities in an ageing world. In parts of the ,, by contrast, a booming youth population, coupled with a shortage of jobs, risks instability.,\u00a0It's the biggest , in business history: more than , is being spent on data centres for artificial intelligence (AI), even though companies are still not sure how to use it and adoption rates are low (though many workers may simply be using it in secret). Will investors lose their nerve, or will AI prove its worth, as \"agentic\" systems become more capable and AI-developed drugs emerge?,\u00a0The global movement of people, not just goods, faces increasing friction. Conflict is disrupting global aviation. , is adding new border checks, and its borderless Schengen system is fraying. The backlash against \"overtourism\" will diminish in 2025, but restrictions introduced by many cities, from , to ,, will remain.,\u00a0With assassination attempts, exploding walkie-talkies and giant rockets being captured by chopsticks, one lesson of 2024 was to expect the unbelievable.

The Association takes as its mission \"to enhance understanding, appreciation, and enjoyment of the historic White House,\" and its quarterly magazine advances that mission by publishing articles on the history and architecture of the White House and life as lived there through the years.

The overall economy continued in expansion for the 55th month after one month of contraction in ,. (A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.) The New Orders Index returned to expansion, albeit weakly, after seven months of contraction, registering 50.4 percent, 3.3 percentage points higher than the 47.1 percent recorded in October. The November reading of the Production Index (46.8 percent) is 0.6 percentage point higher than October's figure of 46.2 percent. The Prices Index continued in expansion (or 'increasing') territory, registering 50.3 percent, down 4.5 percentage points compared to the reading of 54.8 percent in October. The Backlog of Orders Index registered 41.8 percent, down 0.5 percentage point compared to the 42.3 percent recorded in October. The Employment Index registered 48.1 percent, up 3.7 percentage points from October's figure of 44.4 percent.,\"The Supplier Deliveries Index indicated faster deliveries, registering 48.7 percent, 3.3 percentage points lower than the 52 percent recorded in October. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM, , index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Inventories Index registered 48.1 percent, up 5.5 percentage points compared to October's reading of 42.6 percent.,\"The New Export Orders Index reading of 48.7 percent is 3.2 percentage points higher than the 45.5 percent registered in October. The Imports Index remained in contraction territory in November, registering 47.6 percent, 0.7 percentage point lower than October's reading of 48.3 percent.\",Fiore continues, \"U.S. manufacturing activity contracted again in November, but at a slower rate compared to last month. Demand continues to be weak but may be moderating, output declined again, and inputs stayed accommodative. Positive signs for , include the (1) New Orders Index returning to expansion territory, (2) New Export Orders Index increasing moderately (up 3.2 percentage points but still in contraction territory), (3) Backlog of Orders Index dipping further into strong contraction territory, and (4) Customers' Inventories Index indicating levels were only marginally above 'too low.' (For more, see the Customers' Inventories Index summary section.) , (measured by the Production and Employment indexes) continued in contraction: Employment shrunk, but at a much slower rate, and production took a small step in the right direction. Foundational industries like Chemical Products and Fabricated Metal Products (that provide products and components across the manufacturing sector) continued to show weakness, indicating that recovery may still be two to three months away. , \u2014 defined as supplier deliveries, inventories, prices and imports \u2014 generally continued to accommodate future demand growth, with inventories improving and suppliers continuing to improve delivery performance.,\"Demand remains weak, as companies prepare plans for 2025 with the benefit of the election cycle ending. Production execution eased in November, consistent with demand sluggishness and weak backlogs. Suppliers continue to have capacity, with lead times improving but some product shortages reappearing. Sixty-six percent of manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in November, up from 63 percent in October. The share of manufacturing sector GDP registering a composite PMI, calculation at or below 45 percent (a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness) was 48 percent in November, a 2-percentage point increase compared to the 46 percent reported in October. Two of the six largest manufacturing industries \u2014 Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products\u00a0\u2014 expanded in November, the same number of industries as in October,\" says Fiore.,The three manufacturing industries reporting growth in November are: Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components.\u00a0The 11 industries reporting contraction in November \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Plastics & Rubber Products; Chemical Products; Paper Products; Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal Products; Furniture & Related Products; Machinery; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Primary Metals.,\u00a0data is seasonally adjusted for the New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories indexes.,*Number of months moving in current direction.,Aluminum* (12); Caustic Soda; Copper (2); Copper Based Products; Electrical Components; and Natural Gas (2).,Aluminum*; Crude Oil; Diesel Fuel; Plastic Resin; Solvents; Steel \u2014 Hot Rolled; and Steel Products.,Electrical Components (50); Electrical Equipment; Electronic Assemblies; and Electronic Components (8).,Note: The number of consecutive months the commodity is listed is indicated after each item.,*Indicates both up and down in price.,The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the eighth consecutive month in November, as the Manufacturing PMI, registered 48.4 percent, 1.9 percentage points higher compared to the 46.5 percent reported in October. \"After breaking a 16-month streak of contraction by expanding in March, the manufacturing sector has contracted for the last eight months. Of the five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI,, only one (New Orders) was in expansion territory, the same number of indexes as in October. The Production Index remained in contraction, but the New Orders Index moved into weak expansion in November.\u00a0Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, two (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) registered growth,\" says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.,A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.\u00a0Therefore, the November Manufacturing PMI, indicates the overall economy grew for the 55th straight month after last contracting in ,. \"The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI, and the overall economy indicates that the November\u00a0reading (48.4 percent) corresponds to a change of plus-1.7 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,\" says Fiore.,ISM,'s New Orders Index expanded in November\u00a0after seven consecutive months in contraction, registering 50.4 percent, an increase of 3.3 percentage points compared to October's\u00a0figure of 47.1 percent. The New Orders Index hasn't indicated consistent growth since a 24-month streak of expansion ended in ,. \"Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, three (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Machinery) reported increased new orders. Panelists again noted a continued level of uncertainty and concern about a lack of new order activity, with a 1-to-1 ratio of positive comments versus those expressing concern about near-term demand, an improvement compared to October,\" says Fiore. A New Orders Index above 52.3\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders (in constant ,).,The five manufacturing industries that reported growth in new orders in November are: Textile Mills; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Machinery. The 10 industries reporting a decline in new orders in November \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Wood Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Furniture & Related Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Paper Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; and Primary Metals.,The Production Index continued in contraction territory in November, registering 46.8 percent, 0.6\u00a0percentage point higher than the October\u00a0reading of 46.2 percent. Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, two (Computer & Electronic Products; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)\u00a0reported increased production. \"New order rates expanded only marginally as backlog levels continued to decline, causing manufacturers to reduce output to close the calendar year. As noted in the inventories section, companies are showing signs of willingness to invest in inventory, a marked departure from the last two years of activity,\" says Fiore. An index above\u00a052.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures.,The six industries reporting growth in production during the month of November \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components. The eight industries reporting a decrease in production in November, in order, are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Chemical Products; Furniture & Related Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Machinery.,ISM,'s Employment Index registered 48.1 percent in November, 3.7 percentage points higher than the October reading of 44.4 percent. \"The index contracted for the sixth consecutive month after an expansion in May, which broke a seventh-month streak of contraction. Of the six big manufacturing sectors, only one (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products)\u00a0expanded employment in November. Respondents' companies are continuing to reduce head counts through layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes. This sentiment was supported in November by the approximately 1-to-1.5 ratio of hiring versus staff reduction comments, compared to a 1-to-3 ratio the previous month, meaning less workforce reduction activity,\" says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.3\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the three industries reporting employment growth in November are: Wood Products; Paper Products; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products. The 10 industries reporting a decrease in employment in November, in the following order, are: Textile Mills; Chemical Products; Furniture & Related Products; Primary Metals; Machinery; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Computer & Electronic Products.,Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was faster in November, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 48.7 percent, a 3.3-percentage point decrease compared to the reading of 52 percent reported in October. This expansion follows four consecutive months of slower deliveries, preceded by four straight months of faster deliveries. After a reading of 52.4 percent in ,, the index went into contraction territory the following month and remained there for 20 out of 21 months (with , as the exception). Of the six big industries, none reported slower supplier deliveries in November.\u00a0\"Supplier deliveries moved into 'faster' territory as additional supplier capacity provides material velocity benefits to panelists' companies,\" says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.,The three manufacturing industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in November are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Wood Products; and Furniture & Related Products. The seven industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in November \u2014 listed in order \u2014 are: Primary Metals; Plastics & Rubber Products; Transportation Equipment; Machinery; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products. Seven industries reported no change in supplier deliveries in November as compared to October.,The Inventories Index registered 48.1 percent\u00a0in November, up a notable 5.5 percentage points compared to the reading of\u00a042.6 percent reported in October. \"Manufacturing inventories remain at low-to-moderate levels, as the sector's contracting economy continues to cause panelists' companies and their customers to closely manage working capital, including inventories. This month's index reading indicating a slowing rate of contraction could suggest that companies are now willing to invest more for the future. Of the six big industries, only one (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products) reported increased manufacturing inventories in November,\" says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained ,).,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the three industries reporting higher inventories in November are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products.

Panelists are reporting that the amounts of their products in their customers' inventories suggest a demand level that is neutral for future new orders and production,\" says Fiore.,The four industries reporting customers' inventories as too high in November are: Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The eight industries reporting customers' inventories as too low in November, in order, are: Furniture & Related Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Fabricated Metal Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; and Machinery.,\u00a0,\u00a0,The ISM, Prices Index registered 50.3 percent, 4.5\u00a0percentage points lower compared to the October\u00a0reading of 54.8 percent,\u00a0indicating raw materials prices increased for the second straight month in November after decreasing in September.\u00a0Of the six largest manufacturing industries, three \u2014 Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Chemical Products\u00a0\u2014 reported price increases in November. \"The Prices Index indicated slightly increasing prices in November for the second consecutive month. Aluminum, copper, and natural gas registered slight increases, offset by steel, plastic resins and crude oil moving down in price. Twelve percent of companies reported higher prices in November, compared to 20 percent in October,\" says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.8\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.,In November, the five industries that reported paying increased prices for raw materials are: Textile Mills; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Chemical Products. The six industries reporting paying decreased prices for raw materials in November, in order, are: Petroleum & Coal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Primary Metals; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products.

New export orders continue to be weak, as international trading partners struggle with weak economies, but the slowing rate of contraction may indicate that stimulus measures taken by countries like , and , could be starting to have an effect on U.S. export orders,\" says Fiore.,The five industries reporting growth in new export orders in November are: Textile Mills; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. The five industries reporting a decrease in new export orders in November are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal Products; and Chemical Products. Six industries reported no change in exports in November.,ISM,'s Imports Index continued to indicate cooling in November; the reading of 47.6 percent\u00a0is 0.7 percentage point lower compared to the reading of 48.3 reported in October. \"Imports contracted for the sixth month in a row after five consecutive months of expansion, preceded by 14 consecutive months of contraction.

The eight industries that reported lower volumes of imports in November, in order, are: Paper Products; Furniture & Related Products; Transportation Equipment; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Chemical Products; and Machinery.,The Supplier Deliveries, Customers' Inventories, Prices, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, and Imports indexes do not meet the accepted criteria for seasonal adjustments.,The average\u00a0commitment lead time for Capital Expenditures in November\u00a0was\u00a0170\u00a0days, an increase of two days compared to October. Average lead time in November for Production Materials\u00a0was 79 days, a decrease of two days compared to October. Average lead time for Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies was 44 days, a decrease of two days compared to October.,DO NOT CONFUSE THIS NATIONAL REPORT with the various regional purchasing reports released across the country. The national report's information reflects the entire U.S., while the regional reports contain primarily regional data from their local vicinities. Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of ,.,The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing supply executives based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM,\u00a0makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data\u00a0should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.,The , is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The composition of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is stratified according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and each of the following NAICS-based industries' contribution to gross domestic product (GDP): Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Petroleum & Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture & Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies). The data is weighted based on each industry's contribution to GDP. According to BEA estimates (the average of the fourth quarter 2022 GDP estimate and the GDP estimates for first, second, and third quarter 2023, as released on ,), the six largest manufacturing industries are: Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Machinery; and Fabricated Metal Products.,Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For nine indicators (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Employment, and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. For Customers' Inventories, respondents report their assessment of their customers' stock levels of respondent companies' products , (rather than last month): too high, about right, and too low. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive).,The resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (Manufacturing PMI,, New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries, and Inventories (seasonally adjusted).,Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0above 42.5\u00a0percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 42.5\u00a0percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 42.5\u00a0percent is indicative of the extent of the expansion or decline.\u00a0With some of the indicators within this report, ISM, has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis. For the Customers' Inventories Index, numerically, a reading: above 50 percent is \"too high,\" equal to 50 percent is \"about right,\" and below 50 percent is \"too low.\" However, in practice and in the context of other data, customers' inventories may be considered to be \"about right\" if the diffusion index is between 52 percent (the high side of about right) and 48 percent (the low side of about right).,The , survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to report on information for the current month for U.S. operations only. ISM, receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM, then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month.,The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the , , monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.,Responses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Capital Expenditures; Production Materials; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days.

The study, which surveyed over 3,800 wireless consumers, highlights key trends and shifts in loyalty, satisfaction, and service preferences within the hyper-competitive wireless industry.,The study highlights key trends and shifts in loyalty, satisfaction, and service preferences in the wireless industry.,\n              ,The research reveals that over 70% of wireless consumers earn more than , per year, with 65% using services from the \"Big 3\" carriers: Verizon, T-Mobile, and AT&T. Consumers in this group are all spending over , per month on their wireless services, reflecting the competitive nature of the market. Interestingly, Verizon and AT&T boast a long customer tenure, with many customers remaining with their providers for 10+ years, while T-Mobile's average customer tenure is closer to 8 years.,Despite the long-term loyalty, overall customer satisfaction (OSAT) is notably low across the industry, with a mere 39.1% satisfaction rate.

The overall economy continued in expansion for the 56th month after one month of contraction in ,. (A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.) The New Orders Index continued in expansion territory for the second month after seven months of contraction, strengthening to 52.5 percent, 2.1 percentage points higher than the 50.4 percent recorded in November. The December reading of the Production Index (50.3 percent) is 3.5 percentage points higher than November's figure of 46.8 percent. The index returned to expansion after six months in contraction. The Prices Index continued in expansion (or 'increasing') territory, registering 52.5 percent, up 2.2 percentage points compared to the reading of 50.3 percent in November. The Backlog of Orders Index registered 45.9 percent, up 4.1 percentage points compared to the 41.8 percent recorded in November. The Employment Index registered 45.3 percent, down 2.8 percentage points from November's figure of 48.1 percent.,\"The Supplier Deliveries Index indicated marginally slower deliveries, registering 50.1 percent, 1.4 percentage points higher than the 48.7 percent recorded in November. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM, , index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Inventories Index registered 48.4 percent, up 0.3 percentage point compared to November's reading of 48.1 percent.,\"The New Export Orders Index's 'unchanged' reading of 50 percent is 1.3 percentage points higher than the 48.7 percent registered in November.

Demand showed signs of improving, while output stabilized and inputs stayed accommodative. , analysis includes: the (1) New Orders Index remaining in expansion territory, (2) New Export Orders Index increasing (up 1.3 percentage points and now 'unchanged'), (3) Backlog of Orders Index slowing its rate of decline but continuing in contraction territory, and (4) Customers' Inventories Index dropping into 'too low' territory. , (measured by the Production and Employment indexes) was positive; factory output stabilized compared to November, indicating that panelists' companies are executing to plan. Employment contracted as final head-count adjustments were likely taken to prepare for 2025. , \u2014 defined as supplier deliveries, inventories, prices and imports \u2014 generally continued to accommodate future demand growth, with inventories and imports improving marginally (though remaining in contraction), prices increasing and supplier deliveries marginally slowing.,\"Demand improved, production execution met November's performance (and companies' plans), de-staffing continued (but should end soon), and price growth was marginal. Fifty-two percent of manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in December, down from 66 percent in November. The share of manufacturing sector GDP registering a composite PMI, calculation at or below 45 percent (a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness) was 49 percent in December, a 1-percentage point increase compared to the 48 percent reported in November. None of the six largest manufacturing industries expanded in December, down from two in November,\" says Fiore.,The seven manufacturing industries reporting growth in December \u2014 listed in order \u2014 are: Primary Metals; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Wood Products; Furniture & Related Products; Paper Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Plastics & Rubber Products.\u00a0The seven industries reporting contraction in December \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Fabricated Metal Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Machinery; Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; and Nonmetallic Mineral Products.,\u00a0data is seasonally adjusted for the New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories indexes.,*Number of months moving in current direction.,Aluminum (13); Caustic Soda (2); Copper (3); Electronic Components; Labor \u2014 Temporary; Methanol; Natural Gas (3); Packaging Materials; Steel \u2014 General*; Steel \u2014 High Carbon; and Steel-Making Elements*.,Diesel Fuel (2); Plastic Resin (2); Polypropylene Resin; Solvents (2); Steel \u2014 General*; Steel \u2014 Hot Rolled (2); Steel \u2014 Scrap; and Steel-Making Elements*.,Electrical Components (51); Electronic Components (9); and Labor \u2014 Construction Services and Skilled.,Note: The number of consecutive months the commodity is listed is indicated after each item.,*Indicates both up and down in price.,The U.S. manufacturing sector contracted for the ninth consecutive month in December, as the Manufacturing PMI, registered 49.3 percent, 0.9 percentage point higher compared to the 48.4 percent reported in November. \"After breaking a 16-month streak of contraction by expanding in March, the manufacturing sector has contracted for the last nine months. Of the five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI,, three (New Orders, Production and Supplier Deliveries) were in expansion territory, compared to only one in November. The Employment Index remained in contraction, but the New Orders Index moved further into expansion in December.\u00a0Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, none registered growth,\" says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.,A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.5 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.\u00a0Therefore, the December Manufacturing PMI, indicates the overall economy grew for the 56th straight month after last contracting in ,. \"The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI, and the overall economy indicates that the December\u00a0reading (49.3 percent) corresponds to a change of plus-1.9 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,\" says Fiore.,ISM,'s New Orders Index expanded in December\u00a0for the second consecutive month after seven months in contraction, registering 52.5 percent, an increase of 2.1 percentage points compared to November's\u00a0figure of 50.4 percent. The New Orders Index hasn't indicated consistent growth since a 24-month streak of expansion ended in ,. \"Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, two (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported increased new orders. Panelists noted an improved level of demand performance, with a 1.5-to-1 ratio of positive comments versus those expressing concern about near-term demand, an improvement compared to November,\" says Fiore. A New Orders Index above 52.3\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders (in constant ,).,The six manufacturing industries that reported growth in new orders in December, in order, are: Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Paper Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; and Computer & Electronic Products.\u00a0The eight industries reporting a decline in new orders in December\u00a0\u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Printing & Related Support Activities; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Wood Products; Transportation Equipment; Fabricated Metal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; and Machinery.,The Production Index emerged into expansion territory in December, registering 50.3 percent, 3.5\u00a0percentage points higher than the November\u00a0reading of 46.8 percent. Prior to this month's reading, the index was in contraction territory for six consecutive months. The last time the index registered above 50 percent was in May (50.2 percent). Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, only one (Computer & Electronic Products)\u00a0reported increased production. \"Production levels were stable to November's performance, indicating that re-planning factory floor activity has likely been completed, head counts are likely synchronized with factory demand, and panelists are fully staffed and aligned for 2025,\" says Fiore. An index above\u00a052.2 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures.,The five industries reporting growth in production during the month of December are: Textile Mills; Plastics & Rubber Products; Wood Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Primary Metals. The six industries reporting a decrease in production in December, in order, are: Printing & Related Support Activities; Fabricated Metal Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Machinery; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment. Six industries reported no change in production levels in December as compared to November.,ISM,'s Employment Index registered 45.3 percent in December, 2.8 percentage points lower than the November reading of 48.1 percent. \"The index contracted for the seventh consecutive month and the 14th out of the last 15 months. Of the six big manufacturing sectors, none expanded employment in December. Respondents' companies are continuing to reduce head counts through layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes. This action is supported in December by the approximately 1-to-2 ratio of hiring versus staff-reduction comments, compared to a 1-to-1.5 ratio the previous month, meaning more workforce reduction activity is occurring as we close 2025,\" says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.3\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the two industries reporting employment growth in December are: Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Plastics & Rubber Products. The nine industries reporting a decrease in employment in December, in the following order, are: Textile Mills; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Chemical Products; Furniture & Related Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Primary Metals; Transportation Equipment; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing. Six industries reported no change in employment levels in December as compared to November.,Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was marginally slower in December, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 50.1 percent, a 1.4-percentage point increase compared to the reading of 48.7 percent reported in November. This expansion follows a contraction in November preceded by four consecutive months of slower deliveries, with four straight months of faster deliveries before that. After a reading of 52.4 percent in ,, the index went into contraction territory the following month and remained there for 20 out of 21 months (with , as the exception). Of the six big industries, two (Computer & Electronic Products; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products) reported slower supplier deliveries in December. \"Supplier deliveries moved into 'slower' territory as supplier delivery performance continues to meet the expectations of panelists' customers,\" says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.,The six manufacturing industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in December \u2014 listed in order \u2014 are:\u00a0Furniture & Related Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products. The three industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in December are: Fabricated Metal Products; Chemical Products; and Machinery. Eight industries reported no change in supplier deliveries in December as compared to November.,The Inventories Index registered 48.4 percent\u00a0in December, up 0.3 percentage point compared to the reading of\u00a048.1 percent reported in November. The last time the Inventories Index registered above 50 percent was in August, when it registered 50.3 percent. \"Manufacturing inventories continue to contract, though rates have slowed in in the last two months as panelists continue to manage working capital. This month's index reading indicating a slowing rate of contraction suggests that companies are willing to invest more for the future, to (1) better perform to their customers' delivery demands or (2) advance material deliveries to avoid potential tariffs, or a combination of both. Of the six big industries, none reported expanding manufacturing inventories in December,\" says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.4\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained ,).,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the five industries reporting higher inventories in December are: Primary Metals; Wood Products; Furniture & Related Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components. The eight industries reporting lower inventories in December \u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Fabricated Metal Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Transportation Equipment.,ISM,'s Customers' Inventories Index registered a reading of 46.7 percent in December, down 1.7 percentage points compared to the 48.4 percent reported in November. \"Customers' inventory levels in December have dropped to the high side of 'too low.'

Aluminum, basic chemicals, copper and natural gas registered increases, offset by steel, plastic resins and diesel fuel moving down in price. Fourteen percent of companies reported higher prices in December, compared to 12 percent in November,\" says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.8\u00a0percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.,In December, the seven industries that reported paying increased prices for raw materials, in order, are: Primary Metals; Wood Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components.\u00a0The three industries report paying decreased prices for raw materials in December are: Plastics & Rubber Products; Chemical Products; and Fabricated Metal Products. Seven industries reported no change in prices in December as compared to November.,ISM,'s Backlog of Orders Index registered 45.9 percent, an increase of 4.1 percentage points compared to the November reading of 41.8 percent, indicating order backlogs contracted for the 27th consecutive month after a 27-month period of expansion. Of the six largest manufacturing industries, two (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported expanded order backlogs in December. \"In December, the index recorded its best performance since , (45.4 percent), as new orders coupled with stable production levels slowed the rate of declining backlogs,\" says Fiore.,Of the 18 manufacturing industries, three reported growth in order backlogs in December: Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components. The 10 industries reporting lower backlogs in December\u00a0\u2014 in the following order \u2014 are: Textile Mills; Primary Metals; Printing & Related Support Activities; Furniture & Related Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Wood Products; Machinery; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing.,ISM,'s New Export Orders Index registered an \"unchanged\" reading of 50 percent\u00a0in December, up 1.3 percentage points from November's\u00a0reading of 48.7 percent. \"The New Export Orders Index reading indicates that export orders were 'unchanged' from last month, following six straight months of contraction. New export orders stabilized this month as international trading partners are showing signs of demand recovery as we enter 2025,\" says Fiore.,The four industries reporting growth in new export orders in December are: Plastics & Rubber Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing.\u00a0The four industries reporting a decrease in new export orders in December are: Primary Metals; Transportation Equipment; Machinery; and Chemical Products. Eight industries reported no change in exports in December.,ISM,'s Imports Index continued to indicate cooling in December; the reading of 49.7 percent\u00a0is 2.1 percentage points higher compared to the reading of 47.6 reported in November. \"Imports contracted for the seventh month in a row after five consecutive months of expansion, preceded by 14 consecutive months of contraction. Imports moved closer to growth as inventory constraints weaken and panelists act to better absorb any potential tariff impact in the future,\" says Fiore.,The seven industries reporting an increase in import volumes in December, in order, are: Wood Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Furniture & Related Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Computer & Electronic Products.\u00a0The five industries that reported lower volumes of imports in December are: Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Primary Metals; Transportation Equipment; and Fabricated Metal Products.,The Supplier Deliveries, Customers' Inventories, Prices, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, and Imports indexes do not meet the accepted criteria for seasonal adjustments.,The average\u00a0commitment lead time for Capital Expenditures in December\u00a0was\u00a0175\u00a0days, an increase of five days compared to November. Average lead time in December for Production Materials\u00a0was 81 days, an increase of two days compared to November. Average lead time for Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO)\u00a0Supplies\u00a0was 46 days, an increase of two days compared to November.,DO NOT CONFUSE THIS NATIONAL REPORT with the various regional purchasing reports released across the country. The national report's information reflects the entire U.S., while the regional reports contain primarily regional data from their local vicinities. Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of ,.,The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing supply executives based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM,\u00a0makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data\u00a0should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.,The , is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The composition of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is stratified according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and each of the following NAICS-based industries' contribution to gross domestic product (GDP): Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Petroleum & Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture & Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies). The data is weighted based on each industry's contribution to GDP. According to BEA estimates (the average of the fourth quarter 2022 GDP estimate and the GDP estimates for first, second, and third quarter 2023, as released on ,), the six largest manufacturing industries are: Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Machinery; and Fabricated Metal Products.,Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For nine indicators (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Employment, and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. For Customers' Inventories, respondents report their assessment of their customers' stock levels of respondent companies' products , (rather than last month): too high, about right, and too low. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive).,The resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (Manufacturing PMI,, New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries, and Inventories (seasonally adjusted).,Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A Manufacturing PMI,\u00a0above 42.5\u00a0percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 42.5\u00a0percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 42.5\u00a0percent is indicative of the extent of the expansion or decline.\u00a0With some of the indicators within this report, ISM, has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis. For the Customers' Inventories Index, numerically, a reading: above 50 percent is \"too high,\" equal to 50 percent is \"about right,\" and below 50 percent is \"too low.\" However, in practice and in the context of other data, customers' inventories may be considered to be \"about right\" if the diffusion index is between 52 percent (the high side of about right) and 48 percent (the low side of about right).,The , survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to report on information for the current month for U.S. operations only. ISM, receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM, then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month.,The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the , , monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.,Responses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Capital Expenditures; Production Materials; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days.
