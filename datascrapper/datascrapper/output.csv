Produced on TSMC's 2nm process, the working silicon is part of the Marvell platform for developing custom XPUs, switches and other technology to help cloud service providers elevate the performance, efficiency, and economic potential of their worldwide operations.,Given a projected 45% TAM growth annually, custom silicon is expected to account for approximately 25% of the market for accelerated compute by 2028,.,The Marvell platform strategy centers around developing a comprehensive portfolio of semiconductor IP—including electrical and optical serializer/deserializers (SerDes), die-to-die interconnects for 2D and 3D devices, advanced packaging technologies, silicon photonics, custom high-bandwidth memory (HBM) compute architecture, on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM), system-on-chip (SoC) fabrics, and compute fabric interfaces such as PCIe Gen 7—that serve as building blocks for developing custom AI accelerators, CPUs, optical DSPs, high-performance switches and other technologies.,Starting with the launch of the , in 2020, Marvell has been at the forefront of developing products produced on advanced technology nodes to market. Marvell announced the industry's leading 3nm platform in 2022, with , and ,.,""The platform approach enables us to accelerate the development of market-leading high-speed SerDes and other critical technologies on the latest process manufacturing nodes, which in turn enables Marvell and its customers to accelerate the development of XPUs and other accelerated infrastructure technologies,"" said ,, chief development officer at Marvell. ""Our longstanding collaboration with TSMC plays a pivotal role in helping Marvell develop complex silicon solutions with industry-leading performance, transistor density and efficiency."",Additionally, Marvell delivered a 3D simultaneous bi-directional I/O operating at speeds up to 6.4 Gbits/second for connecting vertically stacked die inside of chiplets. Today, the I/O pathways connecting stacks of die are typically unidirectional. Shifting to a bi-directional I/O gives designers the ability to increase bandwidth by up to two times and/or reduce the number of connections by 50%.,3D simultaneous bi-directional I/O will also give chip designers greater flexibility in design. Today's most advanced chips exceed the size of the reticle, or photomask, for outlining transistor patterns onto silicon. To increase transistor count, an estimated 30% of all advanced node processors are expected to be based around chiplet designs, where multiple chips are combined into the same package,. With 3D simultaneous bi-directional I/O, designers will be able to combine more die into increasingly taller stacks for 2.5D, 3D and 3.5D devices that provide more capabilities than a traditional monolithic silicon device while still functioning like a single device.,""TSMC is pleased to collaborate with Marvell on the development of its 2nm platform and the delivery of its first silicon,"" said Dr. ,, senior vice president of business development and global sales, and deputy co-chief operating officer at TSMC.

The overall economy continued in expansion for the 58th month after one month of contraction in ,. (A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.3 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy.) The New Orders Index dropped back into contraction territory after expanding for three months, registering 48.6 percent, 6.5 percentage points lower than the 55.1 percent recorded in January. The February reading of the Production Index (50.7 percent) is 1.8 percentage points lower than January's figure of 52.5 percent. The index expanded for the second month in a row after eight months in contraction. The Prices Index surged further into expansion (or 'increasing') territory, registering 62.4 percent, up 7.5 percentage points compared to the reading of 54.9 percent in January. The Backlog of Orders Index registered 46.8 percent, up 1.9 percentage points compared to the 44.9 percent recorded in January. The Employment Index registered 47.6 percent, down 2.7 percentage points from January's figure of 50.3 percent.,""The Supplier Deliveries Index indicated further slowing deliveries, registering 54.5 percent, 3.6 percentage points higher than the 50.9 percent recorded in January. (Supplier Deliveries is the only ISM, , index that is inversed; a reading of above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries, which is typical as the economy improves and customer demand increases.) The Inventories Index registered 49.9 percent, up 4 percentage points compared to January's reading of 45.9 percent.,""The New Export Orders Index reading of 51.4 percent is 1 percentage point lower than the reading of 52.4 percent registered in January.

Demand weakened, while output stabilized and inputs, for the first time in several months, contributed to PMI, growth. Indications that , weakened include: the (1) New Orders Index dropped into contraction territory, (2) New Export Orders Index continued expanding, but at a slower rate, (3) Backlog of Orders Index continued in contraction, but moved upward, and (4) Customers' Inventories Index moved further into 'too low' territory. , (measured by the Production and Employment indexes) was stable. Factory output marginally expanded compared to January, indicating that panelists' companies are being cautious about ramping up output in the face of economic headwinds. The Employment Index moved back into contraction, as panelists' companies continued to release workers. More companies cited 'attriting down' as the best process, with destaffing not as urgent as it was in the second half of 2024. , — defined as supplier deliveries, inventories, prices and imports — revealed the first signs of supplier difficulties due to some pull-forward deliveries and discussions about who will pay for tariffs. Inventories recovered somewhat as a result.,""Demand eased, production stabilized, and destaffing continued as panelists' companies experience the first operational shock of the new administration's tariff policy. Prices growth accelerated due to tariffs, causing new order placement backlogs, supplier delivery stoppages and manufacturing inventory impacts. Although tariffs do not go into force until mid-March, spot commodity prices have already risen about 20 percent. Twenty-four percent of manufacturing gross domestic product (GDP) contracted in February, down from 43 percent in January. The share of manufacturing sector GDP registering a composite PMI, calculation at or below 45 percent (a good barometer of overall manufacturing weakness) was 2 percent in February, a 6-percentage point improvement compared to the 8 percent reported in January. Of the six largest manufacturing industries, four (Petroleum & Coal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment) expanded in February, equaling the number in January,"" says Fiore.,The 10 manufacturing industries reporting growth in February — listed in order — are: Petroleum & Coal Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; Wood Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Fabricated Metal Products; and Transportation Equipment. The five industries reporting contraction in February are: Furniture & Related Products; Textile Mills; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Machinery., data is seasonally adjusted for the New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories indexes.,*Number of months moving in current direction.,Aluminum (15); Cocoa Beans; Copper; Electrical Components; Electronic Components; Labor — Temporary; Natural Gas (5); Plastic Resin; Polypropylene Resin; Solvents; Steel; Steel — Carbon; Steel — Hot Rolled; and Steel — Scrap (2).,Ocean Freight.,Electrical Components (53).,Note: The number of consecutive months the commodity is listed is indicated after each item.,The U.S. manufacturing sector expanded for the second consecutive month in February after 26 months of contraction, as the Manufacturing PMI, registered 50.3 percent, 0.6 percentage point lower compared to the 50.9 percent reported in January. ""Although the PMI, took a step back in February, it increased by four percentage points over the three previous months, with the most recent bump in January finally returning the manufacturing sector to expansion. Of the five subindexes that directly factor into the Manufacturing PMI,, two (Production and Supplier Deliveries) were in expansion territory, compared to four in January. Both the Employment and the New Orders indexes returned to contraction. Of the six biggest manufacturing industries, four (Petroleum & Coal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment) registered growth,"" says Fiore. A reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing sector is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally contracting.,A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.3 percent, over a period of time, generally indicates an expansion of the overall economy. Therefore, the February Manufacturing PMI, indicates the overall economy grew for the 58th straight month after last contracting in ,. ""The past relationship between the Manufacturing PMI, and the overall economy indicates that the February reading (50.3 percent) corresponds to a change of plus-2.2 percent in real gross domestic product (GDP) on an annualized basis,"" says Fiore.,ISM,'s New Orders Index contracted in February after expanding for three consecutive months, registering 48.6 percent, a decrease of 6.5 percentage points compared to January's figure of 55.1 percent. This is the steepest single-month decline since ,, when the index dropped 15.1 percentage points. The New Orders Index hasn't indicated consistent growth since a 24-month streak of expansion ended in ,. ""Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, four (Petroleum & Coal Products; Machinery; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products) reported increased new orders. The other two, Computer & Electronic Products; and Transportation Equipment, reported declines. Panelists noted a weakening level of demand performance, with a 1.3-to-1 ratio of positive comments versus those expressing concern about near-term demand. Orders have also been impacted by discussions of which party will pay for potential tariff costs, causing a slowing in order placement. In addition, there is diminished confidence not only in additional interest rate cuts, but also the decline in long-term rates affecting durable goods and construction activity,"" says Fiore. A New Orders Index above 52.1 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Census Bureau's series on manufacturing orders (in constant ,).,The nine manufacturing industries that reported growth in new orders in February, in order, are: Petroleum & Coal Products; Wood Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; Machinery; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products. The six industries reporting a decline in new orders in February, in order, are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; Furniture & Related Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Computer & Electronic Products; and Transportation Equipment.,The Production Index was in expansion territory in February for the second straight month, registering 50.7 percent, 1.8 percentage points lower than the January reading of 52.5 percent. Prior to January's reading, the index was in contraction territory for eight consecutive months. Prior to the last two months, the last time the index registered above 50 percent was in , (50.7 percent). Of the six largest manufacturing sectors, three (Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment) reported increased production. ""Production levels in February were similar to January's performance, as order books remain weak and new orders remain elusive,"" says Fiore. An index above 52.1 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Federal Reserve Board's Industrial Production figures.,The seven industries reporting growth in production during the month of February, in order, are: Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Plastics & Rubber Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Chemical Products; and Transportation Equipment. The four industries reporting a decrease in production in February are: Textile Mills; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; and Machinery. Six industries reported no change in production levels in February as compared to January.,ISM,'s Employment Index registered 47.6 percent in February, 2.7 percentage points lower than January's reading of 50.3 percent. ""The index has returned to contraction after expanding for a single month. Since ,, the Employment Index has contracted 27 of the last 34 months. Of the six big manufacturing sectors, only one (Transportation Equipment) expanded employment in February. Respondents' companies are continuing to reduce head counts through layoffs, attrition and hiring freezes. This action is supported by a second straight month with an approximate 1-to-1 ratio of hiring versus staff-reduction comments. Panelists are continuing to release employees as the business environment becomes more unclear,"" says Fiore. An Employment Index above 50.3 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) data on manufacturing employment.,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the six industries reporting employment growth in February — in the following order — are: Plastics & Rubber Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Fabricated Metal Products; and Transportation Equipment. The nine industries reporting a decrease in employment in February, in the following order, are: Textile Mills; Furniture & Related Products; Petroleum & Coal Products; Primary Metals; Machinery; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Computer & Electronic Products.,Delivery performance of suppliers to manufacturing organizations was slower in February, with the Supplier Deliveries Index registering 54.5 percent, a 3.6-percentage point increase compared to the reading of 50.9 percent reported in January. This expansion follows a contraction (which indicates faster delivery performance) in November, preceded by four consecutive months of slower deliveries, with four straight months of faster deliveries before that. After a reading of 52.4 percent in ,, the index went into contraction territory the following month and remained there for 20 out of 21 months, with , the exception. Of the six big industries, five (Petroleum & Coal Products; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Computer & Electronic Products) reported slower supplier deliveries in February. ""Supplier deliveries moved further into 'slower' territory, as suppliers struggled to meet accelerated delivery requests from customers (due to a potential ports strike and tariffs deployment) and as suppliers and panelists' companies negotiate who pays for current tariffs, resulting in the slowing of some material deliveries,"" says Fiore. A reading below 50 percent indicates faster deliveries, while a reading above 50 percent indicates slower deliveries.,The nine manufacturing industries reporting slower supplier deliveries in February — in the following order — are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Textile Mills; Petroleum & Coal Products; Primary Metals; Transportation Equipment; Chemical Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Computer & Electronic Products. The four industries reporting faster supplier deliveries in February are: Furniture & Related Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Machinery; and Fabricated Metal Products.,The Inventories Index registered 49.9 percent in February, up a notable 4 percentage points compared to the reading of 45.9 percent reported in January. The last time the Inventories Index registered above 50 percent was in August, when it registered 50.2 percent. ""Manufacturing inventories marginally contracted in February, as panelists' companies are asking for earlier deliveries of materials due to a potential ports work stoppage and the financial impacts of tariffs deployment,"" says Fiore. An Inventories Index greater than 44.5 percent, over time, is generally consistent with expansion in the Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) figures on overall manufacturing inventories (in chained ,).,Of 18 manufacturing industries, the seven industries reporting higher inventories in February — listed in order — are: Textile Mills; Petroleum & Coal Products; Furniture & Related Products; Paper Products; Primary Metals; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products. The six industries reporting lower inventories in February — in the following order — are: Wood Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Machinery; Fabricated Metal Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; and Computer & Electronic Products.,ISM,'s Customers' Inventories Index registered a reading of 45.3 percent in February, a decrease of 1.4 percentage points compared to the reading of 46.7 percent in January. ""Customers' inventory levels in February dropped into definitive 'too low' territory. Panelists are reporting that the amounts of their companies' products in their customers' inventories suggest a demand level that is positive for future production,"" says Fiore.,The two industries reporting customers' inventories as too high in February are: Wood Products; and Transportation Equipment. The 10 industries reporting customers' inventories as too low in February, in order, are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Primary Metals; Computer & Electronic Products; Machinery; Chemical Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components., , ,The ISM, Prices Index registered 62.4 percent in February, 7.5 percentage points higher compared to the January reading of 54.9 percent, indicating raw materials prices increased for the fifth straight month after a decrease in September. This is the largest month-over-month increase in the Prices Index since an increase of 7.7 percentage points in ,; there was an 11.5-percentage point gain in ,. Of the six largest manufacturing industries, five — Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Computer & Electronic Products — reported price increases in February. ""The Prices Index indicated increasing prices in February for the fifth consecutive month, driven by the dramatic increase in commodity prices as a result of new and potential tariffs. Mill materials (steel, aluminum and copper), food elements, plastics and natural gas registered increases similar to the prior month. The plastics increase reversed a decline. Thirty-one percent of companies reported higher prices in February, compared to 21 percent in January,"" says Fiore. A Prices Index above 52.8 percent, over time, is generally consistent with an increase in the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) Producer Price Index for Intermediate Materials.,In February, the 14 industries that reported paying increased prices for raw materials, in order, are: Wood Products; Textile Mills; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; Furniture & Related Products; Paper Products; and Computer & Electronic Products. The only industry that reported paying decreased prices for raw materials in February is Petroleum & Coal Products.,ISM,'s Backlog of Orders Index registered 46.8 percent, an increase of 1.9 percentage points compared to the January reading of 44.9 percent, indicating order backlogs contracted for the 29th consecutive month after a 27-month period of expansion. None of the six largest manufacturing industries reported expanded order backlogs in February. ""It appears that the extensive decline in order books has dramatically slowed, indicated by three months at moderate rather than significant contraction. By definition, the Backlog of Orders Index will be the last of the four demand indicators to enter expansion,"" says Fiore.,Of the 18 manufacturing industries, five reported growth in order backlogs in February: Wood Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Primary Metals; and Fabricated Metal Products. The eight industries reporting lower backlogs in February — in the following order — are: Furniture & Related Products; Computer & Electronic Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Transportation Equipment; Machinery; Chemical Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components., , , , , ,ISM,'s New Export Orders Index expanded in February for the second consecutive month, registering 51.4 percent in February, down 1 percentage point from January's reading of 52.4 percent. ""The New Export Orders Index reading indicates that export orders grew for a second consecutive month, following an 'unchanged' (50 percent) status preceded by six straight months of contraction. New export orders expanded again, as panelists' comments cited Chinese stimulus impacts and potential counter tariffs levied by , and ,,"" says Fiore.,The four industries reporting growth in new export orders in February are: Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Paper Products; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; and Computer & Electronic Products. The four industries reporting a decrease in new export orders in February are: Plastics & Rubber Products; Fabricated Metal Products; Transportation Equipment; and Chemical Products. Nine industries reported no change in new export orders in February., , , , , ,ISM,'s Imports Index increased for the second consecutive month in February posting a reading of 52.6 percent, 1.5 percentage points higher than the reading of 51.1 percent reported in January. ""Imports expanded this month again after contracting for seven months in a row, preceded by five consecutive months of expansion and 14 consecutive months of contraction prior to that. Imports remained in expansion as inventory constraints weaken, ports labor turbulence continues, buyers try to get ahead of tariffs and the balance of Lunar New Year deliveries arrive at U.S. ports,"" says Fiore.,The seven industries reporting an increase in import volumes in February, in order, are: Wood Products; Furniture & Related Products; Transportation Equipment; Miscellaneous Manufacturing; Machinery; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; and Chemical Products. The three industries that reported lower volumes of imports in February are: Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; and Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components. Seven industries reported no change in new export orders in February as compared to January., , , , , ,The Supplier Deliveries, Customers' Inventories, Prices, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, and Imports indexes do not meet the accepted criteria for seasonal adjustments.,The average commitment lead time for Capital Expenditures in February was 168 days, unchanged from January. The average lead time in February for Production Materials was 85 days, an increase of two days compared to January. The average lead time for Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies was 45 days, a decrease of two days compared to January.,DO NOT CONFUSE THIS NATIONAL REPORT with the various regional purchasing reports released across the country. The national report's information reflects the entire U.S., while the regional reports contain primarily regional data from their local vicinities. Also, the information in the regional reports is not used in calculating the results of the national report. The information compiled in this report is for the month of ,.,The data presented herein is obtained from a survey of manufacturing supply executives based on information they have collected within their respective organizations. ISM, makes no representation, other than that stated within this release, regarding the individual company data collection procedures. The data should be compared to all other economic data sources when used in decision-making.,The , is based on data compiled from purchasing and supply executives nationwide. The composition of the Manufacturing Business Survey Committee is stratified according to the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) and each of the following NAICS-based industries' contribution to gross domestic product (GDP): Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Textile Mills; Apparel, Leather & Allied Products; Wood Products; Paper Products; Printing & Related Support Activities; Petroleum & Coal Products; Chemical Products; Plastics & Rubber Products; Nonmetallic Mineral Products; Primary Metals; Fabricated Metal Products; Machinery; Computer & Electronic Products; Electrical Equipment, Appliances & Components; Transportation Equipment; Furniture & Related Products; and Miscellaneous Manufacturing (products such as medical equipment and supplies, jewelry, sporting goods, toys and office supplies). The data is weighted based on each industry's contribution to GDP. According to BEA estimates (the average of the fourth quarter 2023 GDP estimate and the GDP estimates for first, second, and third quarter 2024, as released on ,), the six largest manufacturing industries are: Chemical Products; Transportation Equipment; Computer & Electronic Products; Food, Beverage & Tobacco Products; Machinery; and Petroleum & Coal Products.,Survey responses reflect the change, if any, in the current month compared to the previous month. For nine indicators (New Orders, Backlog of Orders, New Export Orders, Imports, Production, Supplier Deliveries, Inventories, Employment, and Prices), this report shows the percentage reporting each response, the net difference between the number of responses in the positive economic direction (higher, better and slower for Supplier Deliveries) and the negative economic direction (lower, worse and faster for Supplier Deliveries), and the diffusion index. For Customers' Inventories, respondents report their assessment of their customers' stock levels of respondent companies' products this month (rather than last month): too high, about right, and too low. Responses are raw data and are never changed. The diffusion index includes the percent of positive responses plus one-half of those responding the same (considered positive).,The resulting single index number for those meeting the criteria for seasonal adjustments (Manufacturing PMI,, New Orders, Production, Employment and Inventories) is then seasonally adjusted to allow for the effects of repetitive intra-year variations resulting primarily from normal differences in weather conditions, various institutional arrangements, and differences attributable to non-moveable holidays. All seasonal adjustment factors are subject annually to relatively minor changes when conditions warrant them. The Manufacturing PMI, is a composite index based on the diffusion indexes of five of the indexes with equal weights: New Orders (seasonally adjusted), Production (seasonally adjusted), Employment (seasonally adjusted), Supplier Deliveries, and Inventories (seasonally adjusted).,Diffusion indexes have the properties of leading indicators and are convenient summary measures showing the prevailing direction of change and the scope of change. A Manufacturing PMI, reading above 50 percent indicates that the manufacturing economy is generally expanding; below 50 percent indicates that it is generally declining. A Manufacturing PMI, above 42.3 percent, over a period of time, indicates that the overall economy, or gross domestic product (GDP), is generally expanding; below 42.3 percent, it is generally declining. The distance from 50 percent or 42.3 percent is indicative of the extent of the expansion or decline. With some of the indicators within this report, ISM, has indicated the departure point between expansion and decline of comparable government series, as determined by regression analysis. For the Customers' Inventories Index, numerically, a reading: above 50 percent is ""too high,"" equal to 50 percent is ""about right,"" and below 50 percent is ""too low."" However, in practice and in the context of other data, customers' inventories may be considered to be ""about right"" if the diffusion index is between 52 percent (the high side of about right) and 48 percent (the low side of about right).,The , survey is sent out to Manufacturing Business Survey Committee respondents the first part of each month. Respondents are asked to report on information for the current month for U.S. operations only. ISM, receives survey responses throughout most of any given month, with the majority of respondents generally waiting until late in the month to submit responses to give the most accurate picture of current business activity. ISM, then compiles the report for release on the first business day of the following month.,The industries reporting growth, as indicated in the , , monthly report, are listed in the order of most growth to least growth. For the industries reporting contraction or decreases, those are listed in the order of the highest level of contraction/decrease to the least level of contraction/decrease.,Responses to Buying Policy reflect the percent reporting the current month's lead time, the approximate weighted number of days ahead for which commitments are made for Capital Expenditures; Production Materials; and Maintenance, Repair and Operating (MRO) Supplies, expressed as hand-to-mouth (five days), 30 days, 60 days, 90 days, six months (180 days), a year or more (360 days), and the weighted average number of days.

Share toX Share this article Share toX PEKÍN, 18 de febrero de 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- La última superproducción de animación china, Ne Zha II, ha arrasado en la taquilla mundial, superando los 12.000 millones de yuanes (unos 1.660 millones de dólares) a 17 de febrero, según los últimos datos. Con este hito, Ne Zha II supera a El Rey León y se sitúa entre las diez películas más taquilleras de todos los tiempos. En particular, es la única producción no hollywoodiense en una lista dominada por gigantes del cine como Avatar, Titanic y Star Wars: The Force Awakens. En China, la película ha dominado el mercado nacional, acaparando la mayor parte de los ingresos de taquilla de este año y estableciendo un nuevo récord en la historia del cine chino. El éxito de la película también está causando sensación a escala internacional. Tras su estreno en Norteamérica el 14 de febrero, Ne Zha II se coló entre las cinco películas más taquilleras del fin de semana, según la empresa estadounidense de medición y análisis de medios Comscore. «Estoy impresionada a muchos niveles por los logros de esta película», declaró la animadora estadounidense Sheila Sofian tras verla en Los Ángeles. «Como ya había visto la película anterior, en cierto modo esperaba el mismo nivel, que fue brillante. Pero ésta crece aún más en términos de diseño de producción, diseño de sonido y música. La historia en sí era muy complicada, y todos los giros y sorpresas me mantuvieron expectante todo el tiempo. Estuve muy enganchada, al borde del asiento todo el tiempo», añadió. En medio del frenesí por la sensación de la animación china, el lunes se presentó en el Museo Nacional de Cine de Pekín la campaña «China viaja con películas chinas», cuyo objetivo es aprovechar el éxito internacional de las superproducciones del Año Nuevo chino con la serie de recientes políticas de tránsito sin visado para atraer más visitantes extranjeros a China. Organizada por la Administración Cinematográfica China y China Media Group (CMG), y por China Global Television Network (CGTN) y el Film Channel Program Center, la campaña se centra en la promoción del «cine + turismo» mediante la integración de proyecciones de películas chinas, festivales de cine internacionales y festivales de cine chino en el extranjero, invitando al público extranjero a conocer China a través de la narración cinematográfica. Mediante el fomento de una colaboración innovadora entre las industrias cinematográfica y turística, la campaña pretende desarrollar rutas de viaje temáticas que ofrezcan experiencias de inmersión tanto en la cultura cinematográfica como en los paisajes naturales y culturales de China, tendiendo un puente entre la exposición mediática y la participación de los consumidores. Jiang Qiudi, director de la Oficina Europea de CMG, declaró que CMG aprovechará su red mundial de corresponsales extranjeros y sus asociaciones con cientos de medios de comunicación internacionales y plataformas sociales para promover la campaña. CMG tiene previsto ampliar el alcance y la influencia de la campaña, reforzar las colaboraciones con instituciones cinematográficas internacionales y establecer eventos emblemáticos que pongan de relieve películas chinas destacadas para consolidar aún más la presencia mundial del cine chino. Los cineastas y los equipos de producción de las superproducciones de Año Nuevo han compartido las últimas novedades sobre los resultados de taquilla en todo el mundo. Al acto asistieron representantes de CMG, la Oficina de Cine del Departamento de Publicidad del Comité Central del Partido Comunista de China, las principales productoras y distribuidoras cinematográficas chinas, estudios de cine, agencias de viajes y el Festival Internacional de Cine de la Ruta de la Seda. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-02-17/Initiative-bridging-film-and-travel-launches-in-Beijing-1B4uwlc0Je8/p.html WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM? 440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers 9k+ Digital Media Outlets 270k+ Journalists Opted In GET STARTED × Modal title Also from this source CGTN : la visite de Xi Jinping dans le Guizhou souligne l'engagement de la Chine en faveur d'un développement de haute qualité Lors des Deux Sessions de cette année - les sessions législatives et politiques consultatives annuelles de la Chine - le développement de haute...

PEKIN, 18 lutego 2025 r. /PRNewswire/ - Jak wynika z opublikowanych ostatnio danych, najnowszy chiński animowany hit kinowy, Ne Zha II, szturmem zdobył światowe listy przebojów, odnotowując na dzień 17 lutego wpływy przekraczające 12 miliardów juanów (około 1,66 miliarda dolarów). Ten przełomowy wynik sprawił, że Ne Zha II wyprzedził Króla Lwa, zapewniając sobie miejsce wśród 10 najbardziej dochodowych filmów wszech czasów. Co ciekawe, jest to jedyna produkcja spoza Hollywood w zestawieniu zdominowanym przez kinowych gigantów, takich jak Avatar, Titanic i Gwiezdne Wojny: Przebudzenie Mocy. W Chinach film zdominował rynek krajowy, generując zdecydowaną większość tegorocznych przychodów kasowych i ustanawiając nowy rekord w historii chińskiego kina. Popularność filmu odbija się szerokim echem także na arenie międzynarodowej. Po premierze w Ameryce Północnej, która miała miejsce 14 lutego, Ne Zha II znalazł się w pierwszej piątce weekendowej listy przebojów kasowych, według amerykańskiej Spółki Comscore zajmującej się pomiarami i analizą mediów. „Jestem pod ogromnym wrażeniem osiągnięć tej produkcji na wielu różnych płaszczyznach"" - wyznała amerykańska animatorka Sheila Sofian po obejrzeniu filmu w Los Angeles. „Ponieważ widziałam już poprzedni film, spodziewałam się podobnego, wręcz genialnego poziomu. Jednak pod względem scenografii, udźwiękowienia i muzyki ta część wyróżnia się jeszcze bardziej. Sama historia była wyjątkowo złożona, a wszystkie zwroty akcji trzymały w niebywałym napięciu. Przez cały czas towarzyszyły mi emocje, które wręcz nie pozwalały oderwać się od ekranu"" - dodała. Na fali popularności chińskich animacji w poniedziałek w Chińskim Narodowym Muzeum Filmowym w Pekinie rozpoczęła się kampania „Chińskie podróże z chińskimi filmami"", mająca na celu wykorzystanie międzynarodowego sukcesu chińskich hitów noworocznych oraz serii ostatnio wprowadzonych bezwizowych polityk tranzytowych, aby za ich pośrednictwem przyciągnąć do Chin jeszcze więcej zagranicznych turystów. Kampania, której gospodarzami są Chińska Administracja Filmowa i China Media Group (CMG), a organizatorami China Global Television Network (CGTN) i Centrum Programowe Kanału Filmowego, koncentruje się na promowaniu „filmu + turystyki"" poprzez integrację chińskich oraz międzynarodowych festiwali filmowych, a także zagranicznych chińskich festiwali filmowych, umożliwiając szerokiej publiczności poznanie Chin poprzez filmowe opowieści. Wspierając innowacyjną współpracę między branżą filmową i turystyczną, kampania koncentruje się na opracowaniu tematycznych tras podróży, które oferują niezwykłe doświadczenia z zakresu zarówno kultury filmowej, jak i naturalnych i kulturowych krajobrazów Chin, łącząc ekspozycję medialną z zaangażowaniem konsumentów. Jiang Qiudi, szef europejskiego biura CMG, poinformował, że CMG wykorzysta swoją międzynarodową sieć korespondentów zagranicznych i płaszczyzny współpracy z setkami międzynarodowych mediów i platform społecznościowych do promowania kampanii. CMG planuje rozszerzyć zasięg i wpływ kampanii, wzmocnić kooperację z międzynarodowymi instytucjami filmowymi i zorganizować prestiżowe wydarzenia, które zwrócą uwagę na wybitne chińskie filmy, aby jeszcze bardziej podkreślić globalną obecność chińskiego kina. Twórcy i zespoły produkcyjne stojące za tegorocznymi noworocznymi hitami podzielili się najnowszymi informacjami na temat osiągniętych przychodów kasowych na całym świecie. W tym doniosłym wydarzeniu wzięli udział przedstawiciele CMG, Biura Filmowego Departamentu Reklamy Komitetu Centralnego Komunistycznej Partii Chin, a także reprezentanci największych chińskich firm zajmujących się produkcją i dystrybucją filmów, studiów filmowych, biur podróży oraz Międzynarodowego Festiwalu Filmowego Jedwabnego Szlaku. https://news.cgtn.com/news/2025-02-17/Initiative-bridging-film-and-travel-launches-in-Beijing-1B4uwlc0Je8/p.html WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM? 440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers 9k+ Digital Media Outlets 270k+ Journalists Opted In GET STARTED × Modal title Also from this source CGTN : la visite de Xi Jinping dans le Guizhou souligne l'engagement de la Chine en faveur d'un développement de haute qualité Lors des Deux Sessions de cette année - les sessions législatives et politiques consultatives annuelles de la Chine - le développement de haute...

The WNBA's Napheesa Collier, NFL's Kelvin Beachum, MLB's Brent Suter and Paralympian Ezra Frech have already signed on as ""Team Ocean Captains."" The ocean is vital to life on Earth, producing 50% of the oxygen we breathe, capturing 90% of human-made excess heat and helping to keep our planet cool and our weather patterns predictable. In doing so, it supports the fields, waves and slopes we love, as well as our ability to attend music events, appreciate the arts, cheer our favorite teams and engage in sports. Unfortunately, the ocean is under threat from rising temperatures, plastic and other pollution, and the loss of critical habitats and wildlife — issues that Ocean Conservancy has been working on for decades. ""More than ever before, we need to protect the things that bring us together,"" said Ocean Conservancy's Chief Brand and Communications Officer Jenna DiPaolo. ""Chances are, you are already feeling the impacts of our changing climate on these things that you love. And whether you live on the coast or hundreds of miles inland, the future of your favorite game, concert or event depends on the health of our ocean. By tapping into the joy of what it means to be a fan, we can inspire action and create a global movement that protects our planet for the next generation."" Flooding, extreme heat, fires and other climate effects are taking a growing toll on sports and entertainment events. Wildfires in California caused the postponement of NFL, NHL and NBA games, just months after hurricanes in Florida devastated the Tampa Bay Rays stadium, while a music fan died from heat exhaustion amid an unprecedented heatwave at a recent Taylor Swift concert in Brazil. According to a survey conducted by World Athletics in 2023, 77% of athletes believe climate change had negatively affected athletics, and 83% said they were either extremely concerned or very concerned about the climate crisis. Climate change can lead to heat exhaustion, dehydration, breathing difficulties and other ailments that endanger the performance of athletes and entertainers. As part of the initiative, Ocean Conservancy has launched ""Team Ocean,"" a collective of notable athletes, artists and organizations who will lead awareness efforts over the course of the campaign. The first four celebrity ""Team Ocean Captains"" are: Napheesa Collier, WNBA All-Star, Olympic champion, ""Unrivaled"" league co-founder and EcoAthlete Champion. Kelvin Beachum, offensive tackle for the NFL's Arizona Cardinals and an advocate for ending hunger. Brent Suter, Cincinnati Reds pitcher and board member of Players for the Planet. Ezra Frech, gold medal-winning track and field Paralympian. ""Most people don't understand the role the ocean plays in our everyday lives and the challenges it is facing,"" said Ocean Conservancy's Vice President of Conservation for Ocean Plastics Nicholas Mallos. ""The environmental movement can't afford to go it alone — we need all hands on deck. I'm grateful to Napheesa, Kelvin, Brent, Ezra and all the athletes and artists to come who are standing by our side to protect the future of the places we love."" What Team Ocean Captains Are Saying ""I want my daughter — and everyone's kids — to be able to enjoy the same sports that have brought me so much joy and success,"" said Ms. Collier. ""And that's not something we can take for granted — all of us need to work together. It doesn't have to be scary — sports have incredible power to bring people together, and there is no bigger reason for us to come together than to save the things we love. I'm joining Protect Where We Play because I believe that if we can harness the joy, passion and fighting spirit that sports create in us all, we can achieve incredible things."" ""As a professional athlete in one of the country's hottest states, I know how important it is to protect our teams from heat waves and other climate threats,"" said Mr. Beachum. ""Studies have shown that our home stadium could see $965 million in damage over the next decade from high heat and flooding. Protect Where We Play is about ensuring that future generations can enjoy the same experiences we treasure today and that's why I'm proud to collaborate with Ocean Conservancy."" ""I've dedicated my life to making it possible for more people to participate in the sports that they love,"" said Mr. Frech. ""And that means ensuring that we all have safe and healthy places to play. The recent LA fires affected me deeply — so many of my friends lost everything. It's important that we all do everything we can to reduce the impact of extreme weather events, and the ocean is a powerful place to start. To protect our planet, and to create the best world we can for my little brothers to enjoy sports like I have, we need to protect the oceans. We need to protect where we play."" ""For me, this really comes down to my kids,"" said Mr. Suter. ""My wife just had our third child, and my eldest is just learning to love the game of baseball. Regardless of whether he follows in my footsteps as a pro, I want all our kids to be able to enjoy the game that has given me so much, and I think that every athlete would want the same thing. We can all see that the impact of extreme weather on sports is getting worse — whether that's hurricanes, fire or heat. If we want future generations to play, watch and love sports like we've done, we need to protect them. We need to Protect Where We Play."" What Partners Are Saying ""We aim to connect sports and entertainment venue operators — and therefore teams and fans — with tangible sustainability solutions,"" said Kristen Fulmer, Oak View Group's head of sustainability and lead for their GOAL program. GOAL, Protect Where We Play's lead activation partner, is a sustainability program for live event venues that provides a forum to collaborate with like-minded operators, vendors and partners who are committed to a more sustainable future. Oak View Group is a live event venue owner and operator and investor of GOAL, known for facilities such as Climate Pledge Arena. Fulmer added, ""Protect Where We Play is a great way to fund sustainability activations, spotlight operators leading the critical sustainable operations and elevate the mission to catalyze positive change for all sports and music fans. I'm excited to see this work in practice as we bring this initiative to select GOAL members!"" Other strategic partners to the campaign include the Green Sports Alliance, which convenes professional sports leagues and governing bodies, colleges, teams, venues, their partners and millions of fans to drive progress toward a sustainable future; EcoAthletes, which aims to inspire and coach athletes to lead climate action; and Sports for Nature, which aims to deliver transformative action for nature across sports by 2030. From March 10 to April 22, Protect Where We Play will be the title sponsor of the EcoAthlete Collegiate Cup, uniting hundreds of student-athletes across 28 U.S. college campuses to raise funds for vital coral restoration projects. And from June 10 to 12, as the official ocean health sponsor, Ocean Conservancy's Protect Where We Play will sponsor the Green Sports Alliance Summit in Miami. With more events, activations and opportunities to get involved planned for the coming year, Protect Where We Play is set to redefine the relationship between sports, entertainment and environmental responsibility.

with the World."" A special event presented by the China Media Group at the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, at the University of Chicago, will highlight pathways for cooperation in science, technology, business, and to continue to advance cultural exchanges between China and the United States. On March 10th, ""China in Springtime – Sharing Opportunities with the World"" will host around 100 guests, including diplomats, former governors, professors, entrepreneurs and students from China and the U.S. to understand the complex challenges we face today and the solutions the leaders of tomorrow can provide. As part of the Young Envoy Scholarship (YES) Program, 50 thousand young Americans will visit China through study and exchange programs over the next five years. The belief is that the young can help forge better relations between China and the United States. Students who visited China will tell us about their experiences, how these people-to people exchanges offer them a chance to learn more about Chinese culture, create lasting friendships and help them gain a global perspective. We'll hear from students about their trips to China – the places they visited, the people they met – and how that has enriched their education and bolstered their hopes for improved Sino-U.S. relations. Technology is also important in bridging societies together. It is reshaping industries and economies at an unprecedented pace. Collaboration can take global advancements to new heights. We will discuss how breakthrough discoveries are bringing China and the U.S. together and the role of technology in finding common ground. The event is co-organized by China Media Group, China General Chamber of Commerce - Chicago, and the Future Wanxiang Foundation. (This material is distributed by MediaLinks TV, LLC on behalf of CCTV.

Project Rise Partners Raises Important Questions About Skydance's Merger with Paramount Global in Letter to the FCC News provided by Project Rise Partners Mar 07, 2025, 11:14 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX WASHINGTON, March 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Project Rise Partners (PRP) announces that it has filed a letter with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) urging the Commission to investigate important questions about the proposed merger between Paramount Global and Skydance Media: the influence of a Chinese company reportedly participating in the acquisition over key US television networks and broadcast station licenses in an increasingly unsafe world; Skydance's approach to bundling practices that sucks the oxygen out of the greenhouse of new content, including new conservative and progressive voices; Skydance's approach to rising retransmission prices in an inflationary world; and Skydance's possible plan to replace human talent with bots. ""In filing this letter, PRP joined its voice with those of a chorus of entities, from all walks of life and all ideologies in the media ecosystem, that have also expressed serious and manifold concerns about the Skydance proposal,"" said Moses Gross, Co-Chairman of PRP and Managing Trustee of the Malka Investment Trust ""The proposed transaction poses risks of public interest harms to national security in an increasingly insecure world, to new and independent voices in a world where they are increasingly crowded out, and to consumers' wallets,"" added Daphna Edwards Ziman, Co-Chairman of PRP. ""It is our hope that the FCC will give serious consideration to the questions raised in our letter."" A copy of PRP's full, 13-page letter filed with the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) can be found here: PRP's Letter to the FCC PRP is represented by Baker & Hostetler LLP and Steptoe LLP.

Largest U.S. Kidney Patient Group Tells Disney CEO Robert Iger to Hold The View Co-Host Joy Behar Publicly Accountable for Saying Kidney Donation is Contingent Upon Political Beliefs of Transplant Recipient News provided by American Association of Kidney Patients Mar 07, 2025, 15:24 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX Behar's Callous Remark Made on Day 6 of National Kidney Month WASHINGTON, March 7, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- The American Association of Kidney Patients (AAKP), the oldest and largest kidney patient group in the United States, today called upon Robert A. Iger, Chief Executive Officer of the Walt Disney Corporation, to immediately hold accountable Disney-owned ABC network talent Joy Behar, co-host of The View, for her incredibly callous remarks made on March 6, 2025, regarding living organ donation and her abject lack of empathy toward the 600,000 Americans living on dialysis and the nearly 100,000 Americans awaiting a life-saving kidney transplant. The View is rated among the most watched talk shows on daytime television, with an audience reaching in the millions. For decades, March has been celebrated as National Kidney Month and April has been celebrated as National Donate Life Month. Nearly 40 million Americans suffer from kidney disease, and the kidney stakeholder community uses March and April to drive public awareness of the unmet need for earlier kidney disease detection and greater living kidney donation. People living with kidney failure on dialysis have a mortality rate of over 50 percent within the first five years of treatment. As reported by TV Insider, Behar made her callous remarks of making kidney donation contingent upon the political beliefs of the recipient during a segment of The View aired on March 6, 2025 (watch here). The TV Insider report said, ""Since Donald Trump's election in November, Joy Behar has been one of the most vocal critics of his policies and the supporters who chose him to implement them. Each day on The View, she has some of the harshest critiques for the current administration and is always ready with a zinger on the 'Hot Topics' related to it. So, when asked on Thursday's (March 6) episode whether she could ever be friends with a Trump supporter, her answer was similarly spirited. 'I won't give them a kidney, but I could be friends with a Trump supporter,' she said before explaining her reasoning. 'I mean, the thing about it is, it's not just about politics. It's about morality, ethics, it's about cruelty, it's about discrimination. So those are personal, human values. We're not really just talking about a fiscal conservative [issue of] who pays more taxes. We're talking about you as a human being. So it's hard to be friends with someone who signs on to something like that.'"" In response, AAKP issued the following formal statement: ""We call upon Walt Disney Corporation Chief Executive Officer Robert A. Iger to immediately hold Joy Behar publicly accountable and demand that she publicly apologize for her attempt to create a permission structure to deny a life-saving kidney donation to another human being based solely on political beliefs and her twisted justification that the denial is moral or ethical. In fact, her comments were morally repugnant, unethical, and an insult to the underlying sensibilities of every organ donor, donor family, kidney patient, and person of goodwill. Every day in America, hundreds of thousands of families and friends witness the devastating health and financial impacts of kidney disease and kidney failure as loved ones struggle, and prematurely die, on dialysis while awaiting a life-saving organ transplant. And, every day across America, thoughtful people who truly value life and ethics make the courageous and selfless decision to donate a kidney to save another human being with zero regard to the recipient's political beliefs. During National Kidney Month and National Donate Life Month, kidney patients and allied medical professionals work tirelessly to educate Americans on the dangers of kidney disease and why more living organ donations are needed to close the accelerating gap between the number of kidneys currently available and the number of individuals awaiting a life-saving transplant. All public figures, especially those in the entertainment industry with daily viewership in the millions, have the opportunity to appeal to America's better angels and encourage people to do something meaningful and larger than themselves. The Walt Disney Corporation states their mission is to entertain, inform, and inspire people around the globe through the power of unparalleled storytelling, reflecting the iconic brands, creative minds, and innovative technologies that make Disney the world's premier entertainment company. Mr. Iger, as the CEO of Disney and the parent company of ABC and the ABC subsidiary that produces The View, should exercise swift leadership and tell Ms. Baher she has failed to meet the Disney corporate mission. Further, Mr. Iger should direct Ms. Baher to use The View to right the wrong she created by encouraging Americans to consider becoming a living organ donor and help save innocent lives impacted by kidney disease. In the view of AAKP, this would be a powerful story of reflection, redemption, and inspiration that is more consistent with the mission of the Walt Disney Corporation and the high standard of excellence other Disney talent achieve."" Since 2018, AAKP has conducted the largest nonpartisan voter registration drive in the United States for kidney patients and organ donors and, in 2024, exceeded its goal of engaging over 500,000 KidneyVoters™. AAKP was founded in 1969 by six individuals living on dialysis at Queens County Hospital in New York. These patients organized and then advocated before Congress to make the same life-saving treatment they received available to every other American living with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure. After one of AAKP's patient founders dialyzed in front of the U.S. House Ways and Means Committee in the early 1970s, a bipartisan Congress and President Richard Nixon worked together to establish modern dialysis and transplant coverage for every American suffering from kidney failure. Unlike communist China, America has never made dialysis or access to life-saving organ transplants contingent upon a person's spiritual practices or political beliefs. Over the past decade, AAKP patient members and advocates have helped advance the passage of the bipartisan law modernizing the Organ Procurement and Transplant Network (OPTN) via greater competition and oversight (2023); lifetime transplant drug coverage for kidney transplant recipients (2020); contributed patient insights and lived experiences to inform President Trump's Executive Order on Advancing American Kidney Health (2019); supported new job protections for living organ donors under the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) via the U.S. Department of Labor (2018); and advocated for Congressional legislation allowing HIV-positive organ transplants for HIV-positive patients (2013).

with the World."" A special event presented by the China Media Group at the Polsky Center for Entrepreneurship and Innovation, at the University of Chicago, will highlight pathways for cooperation in science, technology, business, and to continue to advance cultural exchanges between China and the United States. On March 10th, ""China in Springtime – Sharing Opportunities with the World"" will host around 100 guests, including diplomats, former governors, professors, entrepreneurs and students from China and the U.S. to understand the complex challenges we face today and the solutions the leaders of tomorrow can provide. As part of the Young Envoy Scholarship (YES) Program, 50 thousand young Americans will visit China through study and exchange programs over the next five years. The belief is that the young can help forge better relations between China and the United States. Students who visited China will tell us about their experiences, how these people-to people exchanges offer them a chance to learn more about Chinese culture, create lasting friendships and help them gain a global perspective. We'll hear from students about their trips to China – the places they visited, the people they met – and how that has enriched their education and bolstered their hopes for improved Sino-U.S. relations. Technology is also important in bridging societies together. It is reshaping industries and economies at an unprecedented pace. Collaboration can take global advancements to new heights. We will discuss how breakthrough discoveries are bringing China and the U.S. together and the role of technology in finding common ground. The event is co-organized by China Media Group, China General Chamber of Commerce - Chicago, and the Future Wanxiang Foundation. (This material is distributed by MediaLinks TV, LLC on behalf of CCTV.

New Guide to Navigating Illness Empowers Patients News provided by Amplify Publishing Group Mar 18, 2025, 14:44 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX Brenda Snow's new book praised as ""an important tool for those with serious health challenges"" by founder of The Schapiro Center for Multiple Sclerosis WILLIAMSBURG, Va., March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Virginia Founder and CEO of Snow Companies, Brenda Snow, has announced the release of her upcoming book, Diagnosed: The Essential Guide to Navigating the Patient's Journey (Amplify Publishing, March 2025). Enriched with Snow's own experiences as a patient, this book is poised to be a lifeline for patients and caregivers facing serious health challenges. Continue Reading ""Diagnosed"" by Brenda Snow. Snow's personal story is nothing short of inspirational. After being diagnosed with multiple sclerosis (MS), she faced the common challenges of all new patients: discovering a true diagnosis, finding the right medical professionals to partner with, managing a career and parenthood with illness, and navigating the complexities of our healthcare system. Snow eventually turned her frustration with healthcare into action, founding Snow Companies—a first-of-its kind agency that bridges the gap between life science companies and the patients they serve. Snow, through her company, paved the way for leading healthcare organizations to partner with patients and caregivers. After decades of amplifying patient voices, Snow is putting her experience to paper and drawing on the thousands of stories she's encountered to provide essential insight for new patients. Diagnosed, as Snow describes it, is the guidebook she wished she had when she first discovered her illness. ""Receiving a life-changing diagnosis is overwhelming, but patients shouldn't have to go through it alone,"" says Snow. ""My hope is that this book provides people with reassurance, so they can understand and navigate the emotions and fears that will inevitably bubble up on their healthcare journey.""Praise for Diagnosed and Brenda's work has been pouring in from patient advocates and medical professionals alike. Dr. Randall T. Schapiro, founder of The Schapiro Center for Multiple Sclerosis says, ""[Diagnosed] should become an important tool for those with serious health challenges, no matter what their conditions are."" Amy Wyatt, a notable advocate for patients with epilepsy shares, ""Having known Brenda Snow for eighteen years and witnessed her remarkable expertise firsthand, I can attest to her profound impact on those facing a daunting diagnosis and learning to live in a new normal.""Diagnosed: The Essential Guide to Navigating the Patient's Journey is available for purchase at all major retailers, including Barnes & Noble, Amazon, and Bookshop.org.About Amplify Publishing GroupAmplify Publishing Group is a leading independent hybrid publisher that is passionate about ideas and voices that need to be heard.

The night was filled with unforgettable moments such as the performance of ""Ya No Tiene Novio"" which unleashed laughter and cheers when Mau and Ricky's digital avatars appeared on the stage screens. Creatively highlighting the viral TikTok trend ""I have what Yatra didn't have,"" this fun intervention added a touch of freshness and further tightened the bond between the artist and his audience. Another unforgettable moment occurred with the performance of ""Devuélveme el Corazón"", where the audience transformed the venue into a starry sky with thousands of phone lights, tinged with blue and white, elevating the emotion of the moment. The euphoria reached its peak when Yatra offered an exclusive preview of his next single ""La Pelirroja"", to be released on March 20. The preview left his fans completely captivated and eager to hear more. ""La Pelirroja"" is now available for pre-save on all digital streaming platforms. This show marked a significant milestone for Yatra, representing the first time in his career that he has had the opportunity to be so deeply involved in the creation and development of a show. Designed specifically for the festival, the presentation fused the artist's talent with an impressive orchestra of 43 Chilean musicians led by multi-Grammy Award-winning producer, composer, and conductor Carlos López and 4 members of his band. This new proposal took the show to another level, incorporating symphonic arrangements that transformed his hits into a unique and unrepeatable sound experience. The presentation was complemented with a captivating staging that included 16 Chilean dancers, who gave the show an extraordinary visual dynamism. Likewise, the stage production stood out for its innovation, incorporating meticulously selected visual effects and lighting designs. This daring yet sophisticated concept was not conceived as an end in itself, but as a prelude to the next chapter of Yatra's career, offering the first glimpses of the artistic evolution that his new album promises to reveal. Sebastián Yatra elevated the night with a very special guest that made the show an even more unforgettable experience. The acclaimed surprise came with Lasso, who joined Yatra on stage to perform ""Ojos Marrones"", unleashing euphoria in the audience and adding even more energy and magic to a night that was etched in the memory of everyone present.CONTACT: Sebasti Daneilas, [email protected]SOURCE UNIVERSAL MUSIC LATINO WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM? 440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers 9k+ Digital Media Outlets 270k+ Journalists Opted In GET STARTED × Modal title Also from this source SEBASTIÁN YATRA REGRESO TRIUNFAL CON UN SHOW HISTÓRICO EN VIÑA DEL MAR, ACOMPAÑADO DE UNA ORQUESTA SINFÓNICA, FUSIONANDO DIVERSOS GÉNEROS MUSICALES Y LLEVANDO AL PÚBLICO DE LA QUINTA VERGARA A VIVIR UNA EXPERIENCIA CELESTIAL El ganador del Latin GRAMMY®, Sebastián Yatra, encendió el escenario de la 64ª edición del Festival de Viña del Mar con una presentación inolvidable, ...

Digital Travel Credentials Take Off, Achieving 15% Global Penetration by 2032 USA - English APAC - English News provided by ABI Research Mar 18, 2025, 08:03 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX LONDON, March 18, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Digital Travel Credentials (DTCs) are due to become part of the growing identity metasystem worldwide as the newest manifestation of digitalized identity, driven by leading identity and biometrics vendors under the aegis of enhanced passenger efficiency and bolstered security within the travel and immigration subsegments. Yet, simultaneously, DTCs' acceptance and adoption hinges on the different infrastructural features and practical characteristics of Type 1, 2, and 3 DTCs, as well as acceptance from diverse market players and actors throughout the travel continuum. ABI Research, a global technology intelligence firm, forecasts a 15% global penetration rate for DTCs by 2032, as technical specifications, solidification of supporting infrastructure, growing digital maturity, and deepening interoperability converge to prime the digital ID space for DTC deployment. ""While Digital Travel Credentials (DTCs) are a natural evolution from e-passports, their implementation will be gradual due to the security-sensitive nature of travel, border control, and immigration. With many states lacking the digital maturity for widespread adoption, regional and global fragmentation is expected over the next decade. Although some leaders are piloting Type 2 DTCs, gaps in technical specifications for Types 2 and 3 hinder widespread testing, leaving Type 1 as the focus for the next five years. To unlock DTC growth, vendors must collaborate on standardization and deliver seamless, interoperable solutions,"" explains Aisling Dawson, Industry Analyst at ABI Research. Vendors primed for success understand the necessity of partnership and solution continuity, including digital ID giants like Thales, IN Groupe, Idemia, Entrust, and SITA. DTC's potential as a tool beyond border control requires vendors to think holistically, shining a light on those who can bring value-added features and specialized expertise to the table and cater to other privacy-focused use cases like attributes-based disclosure. This includes start-ups like Neoke and established digital identity and biometrics organizations like Inverid, iProov, and Indicio. Pre-existing digital ID schemes and identity-orientated regulation are the primary stimuli fueling regional growth and accelerating DTC adoption, with the North American region expected to take an early lead given the saturation of mobile driving licenses (mDL) in this region. However, Europe will present the most fertile ground for long-term, sustained adoption of DTCs, standing on the shoulders of comprehensive legislative schemes implemented throughout the 2020s. ""To succeed in the growing DTC market, vendors must understand their potential within and beyond the travel industry. Considering the value of each DTC type and its broader applications will be key for market positioning. While slow standardization and lack of harmonization hinder adoption, forward-thinking is essential. User experience is a critical differentiator for private partners and nation states selecting solutions, while concerns over quantum attacks on digital identity remain. Prioritizing quantum-resistant DTC solutions now will help vendors capitalize on emerging opportunities and facilitate the shift toward digitalized identity,"" Dawson concludes.

El robo de vehículos en Estados Unidos disminuyó un 17% en 2024 News provided by National Insurance Crime Bureau (NICB) Mar 18, 2025, 06:03 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX La mayor disminución de vehículos robados en los últimos 40 años OAK BROOK, Ill., 18 de marzo de 2025 /PRNewswire-HISPANIC PR WIRE/ -- Después de cuatro años de aumento en los robos de vehículos, la cantidad de vehículos robados en los Estados Unidos cayó a niveles previos a la pandemia en 2024. Los robos a nivel nacional disminuyeron un 17% de 2023 a 2024, cayendo por debajo de la marca del millón por primera vez desde 2021, según la Oficina Nacional de Delitos de Seguros (NICB por sus siglas en inglés), la organización líder sin fines de lucro del país dedicada exclusivamente a identificar, investigar, prevenir y disuadir el fraude y los delitos de seguros. El estado de Washington experimentó la mayor disminución en el robo de vehículos, mientras que Maine experimentó el único aumento de robos en el país. ""La disminución general de los vehículos robados en todo el país es un testimonio del arduo trabajo y la colaboración entre las fuerzas del orden, los grupos de trabajo multijurisdiccionales contra el robo de vehículos, los organismos gubernamentales y NICB"", dijo David J. Glawe, Presidente y Director Ejecutivo de NICB. ""En conjunto, estos grupos utilizaron datos e inteligencia para desarrollar estrategias viables para ayudar a las autoridades locales a investigar y procesar a los infractores y evitar que se produzcan robos de vehículos en primer lugar."" En 2024, NICB ayudó a miles de agencias policiales locales, estatales y federales en investigaciones de robos, ayudando en la identificación de redes complejas de robo de vehículos y en la recuperación de cientos de miles de vehículos robados en todo Estados Unidos. El año pasado, 850.708 vehículos fueron robados en todo el país, lo que marca una disminución significativa respecto del pico histórico reciente de 1.020.729 robos en 2023. Año Vehículos Robados a Nivel Nacional 2024 850,708 2023 1,020,729 2022 1,008,756 2021 932,329 2020 880,595 Washington, Nevada y Oregón lideraron la nación con las mayores disminuciones en los robos de vehículos año tras año. Los 5 estados principales con disminución porcentual de robos de vehículos entre 2023 y 2024 # Estado Cambio en Porcentaje 1 Washington -32 % 2 Nevada -31 % 3 Oregon -30 % 4 Nebraska -29 % 5 Colorado -26 % Maine experimentó el único aumento en robos de vehículos del país en 2024, aumentando un 2% con respecto al año anterior. El Distrito de Columbia, a pesar de una disminución del 18% en el total de robos de vehículos, aún experimentó la tasa de robos más alta del país, con 842.4 robos por cada 100,000 habitantes, más del triple del promedio nacional de 250.2 robos por cada 100,000 habitantes. Colorado, por otro lado, rompió una tendencia de cuatro años de ser el estado con la tasa de robos de vehículos más alta. Los 5 estados con mayor índice de robo de vehículos (por cada 100.000 habitantes) # Estado 2024 Robos 2023 Robos 1 District of Columbia 842.40 1,149.71 2 California 463.21 534.49 3 New Mexico 458.24 489.67 4 Colorado 430.04 583.25 5 Nevada 394.42 572.70 Dos modelos sedán de Hyundai fueron los vehículos más robados en 2024, seguidos de la camioneta Chevrolet. Las 5 marcas y modelos de vehículos más robados en 2024 # Marca/Modelo de Vehiculo 2024 Robos 1 Hyundai Elantra 31,712 2 Hyundai Sonata 26,720 3 Chevrolet Silverado 1500 21,666 4 Honda Accord 18,539 5 Kia Optima 17,493 Para evitar que ocurran robos de vehículos, NICB recomienda los siguientes consejos: No deje las llaves en su vehículo No abandone el lugar mientras su vehículo esté en marcha Estacione en áreas bien iluminadas Cierre y bloquee todas las ventanas y puertas cuando se estacione Esconda los objetos de valor fuera de la vista, como en la guantera o el baúl Si le roban el vehículo, llame a la policía y a su aseguradora de inmediato. Denunciar un vehículo lo antes posible después del robo aumenta las posibilidades de recuperarlo Si cree que ha sido víctima de fraude, llame a NICB al 1-800-TEL-NICB o visite https://www.nicb.org/how-we-help/report-fraud. Información Acerca de la Oficina Nacional de Crímenes contra Seguros: Con sede en Oak Brook, Illinois, la Oficina Nacional de Crímenes contra Seguros (NICB, por sus siglas en inglés) es la organización líder sin fines de lucro del país dedicada exclusivamente a combatir y prevenir los crímenes contra seguros a través de Inteligencia, Análisis y Operaciones; Educación y Prevención del Crimen; y Estrategia, Políticas y Defensa.

Revela cómo la pugna soviética con Estados Unidos y China reflejó sus ambiciones irreconciliables como autoproclamada superpotencia y líder de la revolución global. Esta tensión impulsó las políticas soviéticas, desde la lucha por el territorio de Stalin en la posguerra hasta el temerario aventurerismo internacional y la arriesgada política nuclear de Khrushchev, la lucha de Brezhnev por la influencia en el tercer mundo y los fallidos intentos de Gorbachev por reinventar las pretensiones de grandeza de Moscú. Las inseguridades perennes, los delirios de grandeza y el deseo de reconocimiento impulsaron a Moscú a una precipitada búsqueda del poder global, con nefastas consecuencias y dolorosos legados que siguen moldeando nuestro mundo.Sergey Radchenko es Profesor Distinguido Wilson E. Schmidt en SAIS Europa y director del Instituto de Investigación Política de Bolonia. Radchenko goza de prestigio internacional por su investigación sobre la historia de la Guerra Fría.

Continue Reading Ronati Studio Mobile and Desktop App La demande d'articles d'occasion uniques et de qualité supérieure, qu'il s'agisse de meubles anciens ou de produits de luxe, croît plus rapidement que le commerce de détail traditionnel. Selon McKinsey & Company, le marché de la revente, d'une valeur de 1 600 milliards de dollars, devrait croître de 10 à 15 % par an au cours des dix prochaines années. Les vendeurs sont toutefois confrontés à des difficultés liées à la diversité et à l'évolution constante des stocks d'articles d'occasion, ainsi qu'à des outils obsolètes tels que les feuilles de calcul et les notes manuscrites, qui sont source d'inefficacité opérationnelle. Studio s'attaque à ces problèmes en rationalisant les flux de travail des vendeurs au sein d'une plateforme cohérente, offrant ainsi une solution complète. « Studio marque une nouvelle ère d'autonomisation pour ces petites entreprises et ces revendeurs.

Les vendeurs peuvent utiliser l'application mobile Ronati pour photographier et partager l'inventaire par e-mail, message texte ou média social à partir d'un ordinateur ou d'une application mobile. Ils peuvent rapidement créer des feuilles détachables ou des catalogues au format PDF, organiser leur stock par catégorie et par lieu, et suivre les coûts. Cette application élimine la nécessité d'utiliser plusieurs feuilles de calcul et documents, permettant aux vendeurs de préparer les données et les images des articles en un seul clic afin de les publier facilement sur différents sites web. En outre, les vendeurs peuvent contrôler l'emplacement de leur stock en ligne, ce qui permet d'éviter les ventes en double et d'améliorer la satisfaction des clients.

Die Gewinnerin To Run the World: Das Streben des Kremls nach Weltmacht im Kalten Krieg , Sergey Radchenko (Cambridge University Press)In dieser neuen, umfassenden Geschichte des Konflikts, der die Nachkriegszeit prägte, gibt Sergey Radchenko einen beispiellosen Einblick in die Psychologie der Entscheidungsfindung des Kremls. Er zeigt, wie der Kampf der Sowjetunion mit den Vereinigten Staaten und China ihre unversöhnlichen Ambitionen als selbsternannte Supermacht und Anführerin einer globalen Revolution widerspiegelt. Diese Spannung trieb die sowjetische Politik an, von Stalins territorialem Ringen in der Nachkriegszeit bis zu Chruschtschows rücksichtslosem Abenteurertum in Übersee und nuklearer Tollkühnheit, Breschnews Gerangel um Einfluss in der Dritten Welt und Gorbatschows gescheiterten Versuchen, Moskaus Anspruch auf Größe neu zu erfinden. Ständige Unsicherheiten, Größenwahn und das Streben nach Anerkennung trieben Moskau zu einem rasanten Streben nach globaler Macht, mit schlimmen Folgen und schmerzhaften Hinterlassenschaften, die unsere Welt bis heute prägen.Sergey Radchenko ist Wilson E. Schmidt Distinguished Professor am SAIS Europe und Direktor des Bologna Institute for Policy Research. Radchenko genießt internationales Ansehen für seine Forschungen zur Geschichte des Kalten Krieges. Er hat über die chinesisch-sowjetischen Beziehungen, die sowjetische und chinesische Außenpolitik, die Atomdiplomatie und die Krisen des Kalten Krieges geschrieben. Er schreibt häufig für , die New York Times, die Washington Post, Foreign Policy, National Interest, die Moscow Times, und andere nationale und internationale Medien.Die Veranstaltung Die Verleihung des Lionel-Gelber-Preises und der Vortrag finden am 9. April 2025 unter 12 p.m. ET statt. wird in einem hybriden Format von der Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy der Universität Toronto präsentiert.Die Online-Anmeldung erfolgt über die Website des Lionel-Gelber-Preises.Der Preis Der Lionel-Gelber-Preis wurde 1989 von dem kanadischen Diplomaten Lionel Gelber gegründet.

Le gagnant Pour diriger le monde : The Kremlin's Cold War Bid for Global Power , Sergey Radchenko (Cambridge University Press)Dans cette nouvelle histoire panoramique du conflit qui a défini l'ère de l'après-guerre, Sergey Radchenko propose une plongée sans précédent dans la psychologie des décisions du Kremlin. Il révèle comment la lutte de l'Union soviétique contre les États-Unis et la Chine a reflété ses ambitions irréconciliables en tant que superpuissance autoproclamée et chef de file de la révolution mondiale. Cette tension a été le moteur de la politique soviétique, de la recherche de territoires par Staline dans l'après-guerre à l'aventurisme inconsidéré de Khrouchtchev à l'étranger, en passant par la stratégie nucléaire, la quête d'influence de Brejnev dans le tiers-monde et les tentatives infructueuses de Gorbatchev pour réinventer les prétentions de Moscou à la grandeur. L'insécurité permanente, la folie des grandeurs et le désir de reconnaissance ont propulsé Moscou dans une quête effrénée du pouvoir mondial, avec des conséquences désastreuses et des héritages douloureux qui continuent de façonner notre monde.Sergey Radchenko est Wilson E. Schmidt Distinguished Professor au SAIS Europe et directeur de l'Institut de Bologne pour la recherche politique. M. Radchenko jouit d'une réputation internationale pour ses recherches sur l'histoire de la guerre froide. Il a écrit sur les relations sino-soviétiques, sur les politiques étrangères soviétiques et chinoises, sur la diplomatie atomique et sur les crises de la guerre froide. Il contribue fréquemment à The New York Times, The Washington Post, Foreign Policy, National Interest, The Moscow Times, et d'autres médias nationaux et internationaux.L'événement La cérémonie et la conférence du prix Lionel Gelber auront lieu à 12 p.m. ET le 9 avril 2025, et seront présentées dans un format hybride par la Munk School of Global Affairs & Public Policy de l'Université de Toronto.Pour vous inscrire en ligne, visitez le site web du prix Lionel Gelber.Le prix Le prix Lionel Gelber a été créé en 1989 par le diplomate canadien Lionel Gelber.

The market is expected to reach USD 218,278.0 million by 2032, reflecting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.20% between 2024 and 2032. The increasing adoption of wireless audio devices, advancements in noise-cancellation technologies, and the rising popularity of music streaming services are major factors driving the growth of the market. Furthermore, the growing trend of fitness and wellness, where wireless earbuds are used for hands-free activities, is also contributing to the demand. The expansion of the market is supported by the continuous innovations in the design and functionality of headphones and earphones. Technological advancements, such as the integration of AI for personalized sound experiences, as well as the increasing use of smart features like voice assistants, are enhancing the appeal of these devices. Additionally, the rise in disposable income, particularly in emerging markets, is enabling more consumers to invest in premium audio devices. The market is further benefiting from the increasing demand for gaming headphones, which are tailored for high-quality, immersive sound experiences. These factors collectively position the global Headphones and Earphones market for substantial growth in the coming years. Key Growth Determinants Technological AdvancementsOne of the key drivers of the growth in the Headphones and Earphones market is the rapid pace of technological innovation. The integration of advanced features such as noise cancellation, AI-driven sound customization, and seamless connectivity with various devices enhances the overall consumer experience. Wireless and Bluetooth technologies continue to improve, offering consumers enhanced convenience and mobility. Moreover, the introduction of smart headphones with voice assistants, touch controls, and health monitoring capabilities has further expanded the appeal of these products. Growing Consumer Demand for Wireless and Portable DevicesThe increasing preference for wireless headphones and earphones is a significant growth factor in the market. Consumers are shifting away from traditional wired devices due to the convenience, portability, and advanced features offered by wireless models. This trend is fueled by the growing adoption of Bluetooth technology and the widespread use of smartphones, laptops, and other portable devices. Additionally, as consumers embrace fitness and on-the-go lifestyles, the demand for lightweight and comfortable wireless earphones continues to rise, propelling the market forward. Rising Popularity of Music Streaming and GamingThe growing consumption of music through streaming platforms such as Spotify, Apple Music, and YouTube has spurred the demand for high-quality headphones and earphones. With an increasing number of consumers subscribing to these services, there is a higher need for audio products that deliver immersive listening experiences. Similarly, the rise in popularity of gaming and eSports has driven demand for specialized gaming headphones, which offer superior sound quality and comfort for long gaming sessions. Both trends are essential drivers of the market's expansion. Rising Disposable Incomes in Emerging MarketsThe increasing disposable income in emerging economies, particularly in regions such as Asia Pacific and Latin America, is contributing to the growth of the Headphones and Earphones market. As middle-class populations expand and purchasing power increases, more consumers in these regions are able to invest in premium audio devices. The growing urbanization and improved lifestyles also play a significant role in driving the demand for high-quality audio products in these regions, further contributing to market growth. Browse the report and understand how it can benefit your business strategy – https://www.credenceresearch.com/report/headphones-and-earphones-market Key Growth Barriers High Price of Premium ProductsOne of the primary growth barriers in the Headphones and Earphones market is the high price associated with premium and advanced audio devices. While consumers are increasingly seeking high-quality, feature-rich products such as noise-canceling headphones and smart earphones, these premium devices often come with a steep price tag. As a result, budget-conscious consumers may opt for more affordable options, limiting the market reach of high-end audio brands. The price sensitivity in certain regions, particularly in emerging markets, can hinder the growth of premium product segments. Intense Market CompetitionThe headphones and earphones market is highly competitive, with numerous established and new players vying for market share. This intense competition, particularly from low-cost and generic brands, creates pricing pressures that can affect the profitability of leading brands. Consumers often have a wide range of options at various price points, which makes it challenging for brands to differentiate their products solely on price. As a result, manufacturers must invest heavily in research and development, marketing, and brand positioning to maintain a competitive edge, increasing operational costs. Product Quality and Durability ConcernsDespite the advancements in technology, some consumers still face challenges related to the durability and quality of headphones and earphones. Products may experience issues such as wear and tear, connectivity problems, or shorter lifespans, especially with low-cost models. Poor product quality can negatively impact consumer satisfaction and brand loyalty, leading to decreased demand for certain products. The frequency of defects or malfunctions can discourage potential buyers from investing in higher-end products or specific brands, restricting market growth. Economic Uncertainty and Consumer SpendingGlobal economic instability and inflationary pressures can act as a barrier to market growth. During periods of economic downturn or uncertainty, consumers may become more cautious with discretionary spending, affecting the demand for non-essential products like headphones and earphones. The reduction in consumer spending power, particularly in developed markets, may result in lower sales, as consumers prioritize essential goods over luxury or entertainment products. The market could face additional challenges if the global economy continues to fluctuate, impacting both demand and profitability.

The show's fusion of fashion and visual art will provide guests with an emotional resonance about individuality and dreams, showcasing a range of unique and groundbreaking pieces for women and men. Continue Reading SELENEE The design of the Garden of Forking Path was inspired by Jorge Luis Borges' short story of the same name and the exploration of ""Infinite Possibilities in a Maze."" The collection depicts a labyrinthine world that symbolizes time, space, and destiny intertwining. Through silhouette, materials, and details of the clothing, the theme of ""forking paths"" and ""multiple possibilities"" is showcased. From classic plaid wool to flowing fabrics, SELENEE utilizes a classic gray and black palette with a combination of sharp lines and flowing curves that capture the mysterious essence of a labyrinth. A collision of vintage and modern sensibilities is evident through plaid fabrics meeting three-dimensional tailoring, reflecting the theme of time intertwining. Corseted coats, exaggerated shoulders, suit dresses, checkered pants, wool blousons, leather sweatshirts, capes, and dresses define this season's collection. Pieces are available on the SELENEE website and range from $480.00 to $5,800. Since its 2023 inception, the brand has been known for experimental silhouettes, and the Garden of Forking Path accelerates this with bold three-dimensional designs and exaggerated contours, exploring the infinite possibilities of material language. This is also expressed in intricate and stunning design details such as cuffs featuring a split design, mimicking the branches of the labyrinth, and a layered skirt that embodies the imagery of multiple intersecting spaces.""Every path is a choice, giving rise to infinite possibilities. Los Angeles is the perfect setting for this collection as it's not only where my dreams began, but also where many of my friends, like me, have found the courage to pursue their dreams again,"" said Motong Yang, Selenee's Artistic Director. ""This show is not only a fulfillment of my original aspirations but also a way to inspire those who once put their dreams on hold due to reality, encouraging them to take a bold step forward. It is for the dreams we once left behind and for the better versions of ourselves.""The show integrates installation art and performance art into an interactive experience, allowing the audience to go beyond passive viewing and deeply connect with the brand's message. SELENEE's underlying philosophy of good design is a result of both aesthetics and responsible and sustainable practices challenge the status quo while embracing innovation.SELENEE is a cross-disciplinary art brand that merges fashion with art and technology, breaking traditional boundaries and setting new trends. MT Yang, the founder and artistic director of SELENEE, is an installation artist and visual artist who is committed to exploring breakthrough creativity across disciplines.

DNE Studios & Nonny De La Pena Pushes Boundaries with Volumetric 4D Storytelling of the 1906 Atlanta Race Massacre at SXSW News provided by DNE Studios Mar 08, 2025, 22:05 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX Nonny De La Pena And DNE Studios Resurrect History Through Volumetric Alchemy: The Technological Breakthroughs Behind The ""1906 Atlanta Race Massacre"" Set To Debut At SXSWLOS ANGELES, March 8, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- As dawn breaks over Austin during SXSW 2025, a spectral revolution materializes at the intersection of 6th Street and Congress Avenue. Bryonn Bain's volumetric incarnation of Jesse Max Barber – the Black journalist who documented the 1906 Atlanta Race Massacre – emerges not as a static hologram, but as a navigable memory field. Selected for SXSW's XR Experience Competition, this collaboration between Emmy-winning director Nonny de la Peña and Digital Nation Entertainment's studio director Addie Reiss represents a paradigm shift in historical resurrection through volumetric capture. Continue Reading DNE Studios & Nonna De La Pena Pushes Boundaries with Volumetric 4D Storytelling of the 1906 Atlanta Race Massacre at SXSW Ghost in the Machine: Reconstructing the ""1906 Atlanta Race Massacre"" in Augmented Reality At the core of Barber's compelling presence lies DNE's Santa Monica volumetric 4D stage – where 120 bespoke RGB-D cameras orchestrated by Reiss' team captured Bain's performance, as a holographic presence. DNE's proprietary structured-light sensors achieved sub-millimeter spatial resolution – critical for preserving the tremor in Bain's hands as Barber recounts watching white mobs burn Black-owned businesses. ""We needed forensic-level capture without sacrificing artistic spontaneity, to convey Bain's testimony and draw the audience into the story."" explains Reiss. Cinematographer's Gambit: Truth in PhotonsIn an era of MetaHumans and AI-generated deepfakes, Reiss's approach to volumetric capture feels radical in its simplicity: ""Record the actor, not an approximation.""""Audiences instinctively recoil from perfect animations, and emotionally disconnect when viewing machine hallucinations or haunted marionettes."" explains Reiss, whose cinematography work on both fiction films and documentaries, taught him the difference between technical precision and emotional veracity. "" …it's not AI trickery, but light and photons bouncing off an actor as a precious moment unfolds"". Viewers can distinguish truth instinctively, and get drawn into the story by Bain's authenticity.Reiss's decade-long journey as an innovator in volumetric capture goes back to the inception of the technology. It is this blend of technical mastery and storytelling acumen that has defined Reiss's career. ""Volumetric capture for me is a natural progression of photography,"" Reiss explains. ""From one camera to many, from two dimensions to three and then four. It's a new science and art, merging into the role of directing volumetric 4D capture.""Mobile AR as Memory Lens: Democratizing Dimensional HistoryThe true innovation of 1906 emerges with its accessibility. Forget expensive holographic displays or bulky headsets. Users can summon Barber's volumetric presence using consumer smartphones. Your device becomes a porthole to the past, giving each user their own perspective on the unfolding events. ""As XR creators, we empower and lead the viewers through the story, yet never dictate their journey,"" Reiss emphasizes, underscoring the power of volumetric capture to finally give audiences agency in how they experience a scene. ""The experience's mobile AR component transforms audiences into active investigators, and volumetric capture finally gives them the ability to choose their own viewpoint as the scene develops.""The Future of Memory: Gaussian Splats on the HorizonWhile the 1906 experience utilized traditional photogrammetric processing, Reiss' team is pioneering next-generation 4D Gaussian splatting imagery for future projects. ""For more than a decade, volumetric capture has been trapped in a polygon prison,"" Reiss explains. Computer graphics, born from synthetic 3D scenes, dictated that volumetric data be processed and 'solved' into millions of polygons. ""We were striving for photorealism using fundamentally unreal building blocks.""That's where 3D Gaussian Splatting comes in. ""We now reject polygons entirely,"" Reiss declares.""Polygons create hard, synthetic edges, and struggle to recreate the fine details of life."" A reflection, fine hair, a glass of wine or simply a glint of light—these were near-impossible to capture and render using classic computer graphics. With Gaussian Splats, DNE can preserve each photon particle into a light field. ""We're now finally free from building a 3D-mesh model,"" Reiss states, ""instead we use the cameras and sensors to paint 3D brushstrokes in space, taking impressions of light in time."" The result is spectacular realism and the ability to convey subtle details impossible with previous volumetric technologies.DNE's upcoming projects are all-in on 4DGS. ""Now, finally, volumetric capture has the paints and brushes to fulfill its claim, to produce an immersive facsimile of reality,"" Reiss explains.Why ""Real"" Matters in a World of DeepfakesAs XR grapples with AI-generated ""actors"", Reiss sees volumetric capture—done right—as an ethical imperative. That's why, in an industry chasing the next machine hallucination, DNE is betting on reality. ""We are now fully committed to bringing that sense of connection again, between an audience and a true talent.""Volumetric capture may be the last media stronghold carrying the legacy of truth.""We're not just building time machines – we're crafting empathy engines,"" Reiss concludes, solidifying DNE's commitment to using technology to create authentic experiences for the audience.Experience ""1906 Atlanta Race Massacre"":World Premiere, SXSW XR Competition Mar 9-11 2025Press Contact: Music Native9087564563studio | Digital NationSOURCE DNE Studios WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM? 440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers 9k+ Digital Media Outlets 270k+ Journalists Opted In GET STARTED × Modal title Contact PR Newswire Call PR Newswire at 888-776-0942 from 8 AM - 9 PM ET Chat with an Expert Contact Us General Inquiries Editorial Bureaus Partnerships Media Inquiries Worldwide Offices Products For Marketers For Public Relations For IR & Compliance For Agency For Small Business All Products About About PR Newswire About Cision Become a Publishing Partner Become a Channel Partner Careers Accessibility Statement Global Sites Asia APAC APAC - Traditional Chinese Brazil Canada Czech Denmark Finland France Germany India Indonesia Israel Korea Italy Japan Mexico Middle East Middle East - Arabic Netherlands Norway Poland Portugal Russia Slovakia Spain Sweden United Kingdom My Services All New Releases Online Member Center ProfNet Data Privacy Do not sell or share my personal information: Submit via [email protected] Call Privacy toll-free: 877-297-8921 Contact PR Newswire Products About My Services All News Releases Online Member Center ProfNet Call PR Newswire at 888-776-0942 Terms of Use Privacy Policy Information Security Policy Site Map RSS Cookie Settings Copyright © 2025 Cision US Inc."

Sojourners welcomed to 'a life called Yunnan' News provided by chinadaily.com.cn Mar 10, 2025, 02:08 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX Yunnan: Province sets year's target at 6 million sojournersBEIJING, March 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- A report from Chinadaily.com.cnWang Ning, a deputy to the 14th National People's Congress and secretary of the Yunnan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, has invited people to sojourn in Yunnan and experience a beautiful life that ""begins with mountains and rivers and returns to the hustle and bustle"". Continue Reading ""Sojourning in Yunnan"" brand famous. Sojourners are travelers who stay for over two weeks, according to the provincial government, and in the process, they have better exposure to Yunnan's lifestyle, traditions and culture. In the past two years, many people came to Yunnan, not just to visit its scenic areas but also to live in the province for some time and have an in-depth experience of ""a life called Yunnan"", Wang said, adding that in 2024 alone, the province received about 4 million sojourners.Yunnan boasts six UNESCO World Heritage Sites, eight national historical and cultural cities, 777 traditional Chinese villages and 624 national Class-A attractions, and is hugely popular on social media platforms.Its rich natural resources and diverse ecological wealth have made it a suitable host for the United Nations Biodiversity Conference.The province is a favored destination among those who love forests, lakes and hot springs, and those who wish to escape the summer heat or the winter cold.According to Wang, sojourning in Yunnan has changed the lives of many young people.Sojourners from Beijing, Shanghai and Zhe­jiang province, many of whom are college graduates, have developed creative businesses by livestreaming about Yunnan's agricultural products, or have opened bookstores and cafes in the province, bringing new vitality to its villages. More villagers now run supermarkets, make express deliveries, and bake bread to boost their incomes.Tan Lijun and her husband, who came from Guangdong province, visited Tuguachong village in Yunnan earlier this year. They noticed that locally made pottery items are special and particularly popular among their friends back home, so they decided to sell these through livestreaming.As more sojourners came to Tuguachong, native residents also returned to run restaurants and supermarkets, revitalizing the previously sparsely populated village.Yannick Benichou, a 40-year-old traveler from France, said he enjoys life in Yunnan particularly because of its pleasant climate.""It is not too cold in winter, not too hot in summer. There are clear blue skies throughout the year,"" he said, adding that after coming to Kunming, the capital of Yunnan, he discovered that he could enjoy outdoor activities such as hiking, camping, rock climbing, cycling and mountaineering year-round.Benichou said he cherishes Yunnan's diversity in terms of ethnic culture, climate and topography. ""From the snowy mountains of Shangri-La to the tropical rainforests of Xishuangbanna, with its lakes, gorges and high mountains, living in Kunming provides easy access to these various sceneries. This diversity is something many people envy,"" he said, adding that the low cost of living is a bonus.The province, which is building its brand ""Sojourning in Yunnan"", aims to attract 6 million sojourners this year, according to the local government.Wang said the province will guide all sectors of society to jointly build more than 3,000 major sojourning villages and develop services in fields such as healthcare, study tour, culture and sports, and elderly care. He emphasized that these measures would increase consumption and promote rural vitalization.""We will upgrade sightseeing into an in-depth travel experience and construct more scenic spots with competitive advantages,"" Wang said, adding that the province will also introduce more ideas and promote various tourism businesses to make the ""Sojourning in Yunnan"" brand famous.SOURCE chinadaily.com.cn WANT YOUR COMPANY'S NEWS FEATURED ON PRNEWSWIRE.COM? 440k+ Newsrooms & Influencers 9k+ Digital Media Outlets 270k+ Journalists Opted In GET STARTED × Modal title Also from this source WIC Asia-Pacific Summit to be held in Hong Kong in mid-April A news report from chinadaily.com.cn： The World Internet Conference (WIC) held a press briefing in Beijing on March 17 to introduce the upcoming WIC...

GLOBAL TIMES: A feast connecting people's hearts: 70,000 runners from China and Namibia compete in Rossing Marathon News provided by GLOBAL TIMES Mar 10, 2025, 03:21 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX ROSSING, Namibia, March 10, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- On Saturday morning, the 34th Rossing National Marathon Championship (Rossing Marathon) was grandly inaugurated in the coastal town of Swakopmund in Namibia, with a ceremonial gunshot fired by Wei Jinming, the Counsellor for Economic and Commercial Affairs of the Chinese Embassy in Namibia. This event unfolded against the stunning backdrop of the vast Atlantic Ocean and the expansive Namib Desert, creating a spectacular racecourse. As one of Namibia's oldest marathon events, the Rossing Marathon is not just a celebration of sports; it is a cultural feast that bridges mountains and seas, uniting hearts across nations. Simultaneously, in China, a ""Cloud Marathon"" was launched online under the theme ""Running with the Antelopes."" This virtual event featured five categories: 3 kilometers, 5 kilometers, 10 kilometers, half marathon, and full marathon, attracting over 70,000 runners of diverse backgrounds and languages. The event, themed ""Crossing Mountains and Seas, China and Namibia Running Together,"" reached its peak with enthusiastic participation from runners worldwide. As a vital platform for China-Namibia cooperation, the Rossing Marathon employed an innovative online-offline integration model to attract global participants. The offline segment included a full marathon, half marathon, 10 kilometers, and 5 kilometers races. Runners on the Namibian racecourse were greeted by the endless expanse of the Atlantic Ocean on one side and the golden vastness of the Namib Desert on the other. Participants from around the globe gathered to measure the grandeur of nature with their strides and to etch their perseverance into the landscape with their sweat. As a premier event on Namibia's sports calendar, the successful hosting of the Rossing Marathon not only drew international attention to Namibia but also provided fresh ideas and models for cooperation among countries in the Global South. The ongoing development of this event will further deepen China-Namibia collaboration in areas such as sustainable development and cultural exchange, contributing to the establishment of a high-level China-Africa community with a shared future and serving as a vivid example of solidarity and collaboration among Global South nations. Namibian Ambassador to China Elia George Kaiyamo remarked that ""China-Namibia cooperation is deepening in the new era, and the Rossing Marathon has built a bridge of friendship between the people of the two countries."" Johan Coetzee, Managing Director at the Rossing uranium mine, said during a break at the Rossing Marathon that ""this year marks the second edition of the marathon that combines online and offline elements,and we have witnessed significant achievements. We plan to further expand the scale of the event,committed to sustainable development and innovation in tandem.We aim to advocate a positive and healthy local culture and promote the exchange and integration of global cultures."" Counselor Wei commented on the event, stating that ""the Rossing Marathon is a vivid symbol of China-Namibia cooperation. Its spirit of unity, struggle, friendship, and perseverance aligns perfectly with the concept of friendly cooperation between our two nations. It has enhanced emotional resonance between our peoples, becoming an important bridge for people-to-people connections. Through the power of sports, it continuously strengthens the public opinion foundation of our friendly relations and has made significant contributions to deepening the China-Namibia friendship."" At the 3 kilometers mark on the racecourse, the Chinese team set up a special supply station that not only provided energy replenishment for the runners but also showcased rich Chinese cultural elements. This display added to the excitement of the event, motivating runners and attracting a large crowd of spectators. This was an invitation to cross mountains and seas. A Chinese runner shared the excitement after completing the race: ""This is my first time participating in the Rossing Marathon. The natural scenery and the enthusiastic atmosphere here are unforgettable. I know that at this moment, 70,000 runners in China are starting the race with me online. I hope that next year, more Chinese runners will come to Namibia and experience the charm of this 'Land of Courage' in person!"" 2025 marks the sixth anniversary of the China National Nuclear Corporation (CNNC)'s acquisition of the Rossing uranium mine. Over the past six years, the CNNC has actively participated in the Belt and Road Initiative, adhering to the principles of consultation, contribution, and shared benefits. The corporation has fulfilled its social responsibilities and promoted the sustainable development of the Rossing uranium mine, assisting Namibia in its overall development. The CNNC's social responsibility initiatives in Namibia, particularly in education and sports, have brought tangible benefits to local communities. The Rossing Marathon's racecourse not only traverses the Atlantic Ocean and Namib Desert, but also connects the hearts of the people of China and Namibia. In this land of courage, the antelopes run together, and friendship endures forever.

Barbara Palacios Named Head Winemaker at Bodegas Casa La Rad USA - English USA - English USA - Deutsch USA - español USA - Français News provided by Bodegas Casa La Rad Mar 11, 2025, 03:00 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX LOGROÑO, Spain, March 11, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bodegas Casa La Rad is delighted to announce the appointment of Barbara Palacios López-Montenegro as its new head winemaker. Palacios is the first woman winemaker from the acclaimed Palacios family of Spain. With her deep roots in La Rioja and extensive international experience, she brings a fresh perspective to the eco-diverse estate in Rioja Oriental. Continue Reading Bárbara Palacios, new Head Winemaker at Bodegas Casa La Rad Bodegas Casa La Rad wines ""We are thrilled to welcome Barbara to Casa La Rad. Her expertise, passion, and commitment to terroir-driven winemaking align perfectly with our vision,"" said Laurent Grumel, winery general manager. ""Barbara's leadership will be instrumental in crafting wines that embody elegance as well as authenticity, reflecting the unique characteristics of our estate."" Palacios' journey in winemaking is both rich and diverse. Following in the footsteps of her father and uncles, she first pursued viticulture and oenology studies in Bordeaux, earning technical diplomas in 2004. She gained hands-on experience at some of the world's most renowned wineries, including Château Margaux and Château Pichon-Longueville Baron in Médoc, and Robert Mondavi in Napa Valley. Her subsequent career has taken her around the globe, refining her expertise with top-tier wine producers in Australia, New Zealand, Italy, Chile, Argentina, and Spain. Upon returning to Rioja in 2005, she dedicated herself to cultivating a small vineyard near Haro planted in 1989 by her father, Antonio Palacios. This project laid the foundation for Bodega Barbarot, her personal winemaking venture. In 2014, Palacios further solidified her expertise by earning an oenology degree from the University of Rioja. Casa La Rad, originally established in the 17th century as a hunting lodge for the Marquises de Legarda, has evolved into the largest single-property wine estate in Rioja. Spanning 800 hectares, the estate features 48 distinct vineyard parcels planted at elevations between 515 and 675 meters above sea level. The vineyards average more than thirty years of age, including 28 hectares of Garnacha, Malvasía, and Viura vines dating back to the mid-1970s. The estate's altitude, microclimates, and rugged terrain contribute great complexity and depth to its wines.Committed to sustainability, Casa La Rad is certified with the internationally recognised FAIR'N GREEN seal for sustainable viticulture. Nestled in the Ocón Valley—a UNESCO World Biosphere Reserve—only 14% of the estate is under vine. The rest is dedicated to old-growth woodlands, olive groves, and grain fields. Since its transformation under new ownership in 2014, the winery has embraced innovative barrel-aging techniques, opting out of traditional Reserva and Crianza classifications in pursuit of maximum terroir expressiveness in its wines.Bodegas Casa La Rad produces 100% estate-grown Rioja DOCa wines under the Casa La Rad, Alma La Rad, and Viña Solarce labels. With current production at 75,000 litres, the winery anticipates growth to 200,000 litres by 2030. The appointment of Palacios marks an exciting new chapter for Casa La Rad, reinforcing its commitment to quality, authenticity, and sustainability.For more information, visit www.casalarad.com.

Continue Reading Bárbara Palacios, new Head Winemaker at Bodegas Casa La Rad Bodegas Casa La Rad wines «Estamos encantados de dar la bienvenida a Bárbara a Casa La Rad. Su experiencia, pasión y compromiso con la viticultura de terroir se alinean perfectamente con nuestra visión», dijo Laurent Grumel, director general de la bodega. «Su liderazgo será fundamental para elaborar vinos que encarnan la elegancia así como la autenticidad, reflejando las características únicas de nuestra finca». La trayectoria de Palacios en el mundo de la enología es rica y diversa. Siguiendo los pasos de su padre y sus tíos, cursó estudios de viticultura y enología en Burdeos, donde obtuvo un diploma técnico en 2004. Adquirió experiencia práctica en algunas de las bodegas más prestigiosas del mundo, como Château Margaux y Château Pichon-Longueville Baron, en Médoc, y Robert Mondavi, en Napa Valley. Su carrera posterior la ha llevado por todo el mundo, donde ha perfeccionado sus conocimientos con productores de vino de primer nivel en Australia, Nueva Zelanda, Italia, Chile, Argentina y España. A su regreso a La Rioja en 2005, se dedicó a cultivar un pequeño viñedo cerca de Haro que su padre, Antonio Palacios, había plantado en 1989. Este proyecto sentó las bases de la Bodega Barbarot, su proyecto vinícola personal. En 2014, Palacios consolidó aún más su experiencia al obtener un título de enología de la Universidad de Rioja. Casa La Rad, fundada en el siglo XVII como pabellón de caza de los marqueses de Legarda, se ha convertido en la mayor propiedad vinícola de La Rioja. Con una extensión de 800 hectáreas, la finca cuenta con 48 parcelas de viñedos distintos plantadas a una altitud de entre 515 y 675 metros sobre el nivel del mar. Los viñedos tienen una media de edad superior a los treinta años, incluidas 28 hectáreas de viñas de garnacha, malvasía y viura que datan de mediados de los años setenta. La altitud, los microclimas y la accidentada orografía de la finca aportan complejidad y profundidad a sus vinos.Casa La Rad está comprometida con la sostenibilidad y cuenta con la certificación FAIR'N GREEN, reconocida internacionalmente, por su viticultura sostenible. Enclavada en el Valle de Ocón —Reserva de la Biosfera de la UNESCO—, solo el 14 % de la finca está dedicado a la viña. El resto se dedica a bosques centenarios, olivares y campos de cereales. Desde su transformación en 2014, la bodega ha adoptado innovadoras técnicas de envejecimiento en barrica y ha renunciado a las clasificaciones tradicionales de reserva y crianza, buscando la máxima expresión del terroir en sus vinos.Bodegas Casa La Rad elabora vinos 100 % de la DOCa Rioja bajo las marcas Casa La Rad, Alma La Rad y Viña Solarce. Con una producción actual de 75 000 litros, la bodega prevé aumentar su producción hasta los 200 000 litros en 2030. El nombramiento de Palacios supone un nuevo e interesante capítulo para Casa La Rad, que refuerza su compromiso con la calidad, la autenticidad y la sostenibilidad.Para más información, visite www.casalarad.com.

Barbara Palacios wird Chefwinzerin bei Bodegas Casa La Rad USA - Deutsch USA - Français USA - español USA - English USA - English News provided by Bodegas Casa La Rad Mar 11, 2025, 03:00 ET Share this article Share toX Share this article Share toX LOGROÑO, Spanien, 11. März 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Bodegas Casa La Rad freut sich, die Ernennung von Barbara Palacios López-Montenegro zur neuen Chefwinzerin bekannt zu geben. Palacios ist die erste weibliche Winzerin aus der bekannten spanischen Familie Palacios. Mit ihren tiefen Wurzeln in La Rioja und ihrer umfangreichen internationalen Erfahrung bringt sie eine neue Perspektive in das ökologisch vielfältige Weingut in Rioja Oriental. Continue Reading Bárbara Palacios, new Head Winemaker at Bodegas Casa La Rad Bodegas Casa La Rad wines „Wir freuen uns sehr, Barbara bei Casa La Rad willkommen zu heißen. Ihr Fachwissen, ihre Leidenschaft und ihr Engagement für eine terroirgeprägte Weinbereitung passen perfekt zu unserer Vision"", so Laurent Grumel, Geschäftsführer des Weinguts. „Barbaras Führung wird entscheidend dazu beitragen, Weine zu erzeugen, die sowohl Eleganz als auch Authentizität verkörpern und die einzigartigen Eigenschaften unseres Weinguts widerspiegeln."" Palacios' Weg zur Weinherstellung ist reich und vielfältig. In die Fußstapfen ihres Vaters und ihres Onkels getreten, studierte sie zunächst Weinbau und Önologie in Bordeaux und schloss 2004 mit einem technischen Diplom ab. Sie sammelte praktische Erfahrungen in einigen der renommiertesten Weingüter der Welt, darunter Château Margaux und Château Pichon-Longueville Baron im Médoc und Robert Mondavi im Napa Valley. Ihre anschließende Karriere führte sie rund um den Globus, wo sie ihr Fachwissen bei hochrangigen Weinproduzenten in Australien, Neuseeland, Italien, Chile, Argentinien und Spanien verfeinerte. Nach ihrer Rückkehr in die Rioja im Jahr 2005 widmete sie sich der Pflege eines kleinen Weinbergs in der Nähe von Haro, der 1989 von ihrem Vater Antonio Palacios gepflanzt worden war. Dieses Projekt legte den Grundstein für Bodega Barbarot, ihr persönliches Weinprojekt. Im Jahr 2014 vertiefte Palacios ihr Fachwissen, indem sie einen Abschluss in Önologie an der Universität von Rioja erwarb. Casa La Rad, ursprünglich im 17. Jahrhundert als Jagdschloss der Marquise de Legarda gegründet, hat sich zum größten Weingut in Rioja entwickelt, das aus einem einzigen Anwesen besteht. Das Weingut erstreckt sich über 800 Hektar und umfasst 48 verschiedene Weinbergsparzellen, die auf einer Höhe zwischen 515 und 675 Metern über dem Meeresspiegel liegen. Die Weinberge sind im Durchschnitt mehr als dreißig Jahre alt, darunter 28 Hektar mit Garnacha-, Malvasía- und Viura-Reben, die bis Mitte der 1970er Jahre zurückreichen. Die Höhenlage, die Mikroklimata und die zerklüfteten Böden des Weinguts verleihen den Weinen eine große Komplexität und Tiefe.Casa La Rad hat sich der Nachhaltigkeit verschrieben und ist mit dem international anerkannten FAIR'N GREEN-Siegel für nachhaltigen Weinbau zertifiziert. Eingebettet in das Ocón-Tal - ein UNESCO-Biosphärenreservat - sind nur 14 % des Weinguts mit Reben bepflanzt. Der Rest ist alten Wäldern, Olivenhainen und Getreidefeldern gewidmet. Durch einen neuen Eigentümer im Jahr 2014 hat das Weingut innovative Techniken für den Fassausbau eingeführt und sich gegen die traditionellen Klassifizierungen Reserva und Crianza entschieden, um die Ausdruckskraft des Terroirs in seinen Weinen zu optimieren.Bodegas Casa La Rad produziert 100%ige Rioja DOCa-Weine unter die Markennamen Casa La Rad, Alma La Rad und Viña Solarce. Die derzeitige Produktion von 75.000 Litern soll bis 2030 auf 200.000 Liter ansteigen. Die Ernennung von Palacios markiert ein aufregendes neues Kapitel für Casa La Rad und unterstreicht das Engagement für Qualität, Authentizität und Nachhaltigkeit.Weitere Informationen finden Sie unter www.casalarad.com.
